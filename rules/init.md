- [x] Step 2: Complete PROJECT_MAP.md baseline
- [x] Step 3: Complete ROADMAP.md with current state
- [x] Step 4: Write DEV_JOURNAL Chapter 0 (Genesis)
- [x] Step 5: Verify DIRECTIVE.md needs no project-specific additions
- [x] Step 6: Mark this file as complete
- [ ] Step 7: Commit everything as "docs: initialize AI documentation system"

## Post-Initialization Notes

The documentation system is now ready for use:

1. **Future sessions** should start by reading `directive.md`
2. **Chapter 1** will be the first real development session
3. **All prior work** is referenced as "Pre-docs" in the system
4. **Current focus** is Phase 3 completion (see ROADMAP.md)

### Overview

This project has existing code, decisions, and history that predates the documentation system. This file guides you through creating a baseline so future sessions have proper context.

The goal is NOT to recreate perfect history. It's to establish:
1. What exists now
2. What decisions led here (as best we can recall)
3. What's left to build
4. A clean starting point for real session tracking

### Tips for Imperfect Initialization

**It won't be perfect. That's okay.**

- Better to have 70% captured than to delay trying to get 100%
- You'll fill gaps as you encounter them in future sessions
- Mark uncertainty explicitly — "I think..." or "Confidence: Low"
- Chapter 1 can include corrections or additions to Chapter 0
- The system is designed to accumulate knowledge over time

**What matters most:**

1. ROADMAP accurately reflects what's done vs. not done
2. PROJECT_MAP captures enough for an AI to understand the codebase
3. Chapter 0 gives honest context about where we're starting from
4. Next Action is clear so Chapter 1 can begin real work
