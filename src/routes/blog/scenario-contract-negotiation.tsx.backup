          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3A3A35" }}>
            Sarah had done everything right. Six months of building the
            relationship. Perfect discovery calls. A demo that had the entire
            buying committee nodding. The verbal yes came on a Thursday. On
            Friday, procurement called: "We love your solution, but we need to
            talk about that price. It's 30% higher than what we budgeted."
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
            Sarah panicked. She offered 15% off before the sentence was
            finished. Procurement thanked her, then asked about payment terms.
            She extended to Net-60. They asked about implementation fees. She
            waived them. By the time the contract was signed, Sarah had given
            away $47,000 in value. Her manager was not pleased.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
            What Sarah experienced is not uncommon. According to a Gong.io
            analysis of over 100,000 sales calls,{" "}
            <strong>
              salespeople who discount on the first ask close 35% fewer deals
            </strong>{" "}
            than those who push back. The data is counterintuitive: holding firm
            actually increases close rates. But in the heat of the moment, with
            a deal on the line, most sellers cave.

          <p className="leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
            Chris Voss, former FBI lead hostage negotiator, argues that most
            people negotiate like hostages themselves: afraid to lose what they
            have, they give away everything to avoid conflict. The techniques
            that work in hostage negotiations (staying calm, asking calibrated
            questions, never caving under pressure) work equally well in
            contract negotiations.

            The problem is not knowledge. Most salespeople know they should not
            cave on price. They have read the books. They have attended the
            trainings. The problem is execution under pressure.

            When a buyer says "your price is too high," your nervous system
            activates. Fight, flight, or freeze. Most salespeople freeze, then
            flight. They offer a discount to make the discomfort go away. The
            deal closes, but at terms that erode margin and train the buyer to
            always push on price.

            <p className="mb-3 text-sm" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
              <strong>What it is:</strong> Open-ended questions starting with

            <p className="mb-3 text-sm" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Forces the buyer to consider your
              constraints without you arguing. Creates empathy. Avoids direct
              confrontation while revealing their real flexibility.

              <strong>Why it works:</strong> When you cave quickly, buyers

              <strong>What it is:</strong> Your emotional state communicates
              more than your words. When you stay calm under pressure, buyers
              interpret it as confidence.

            <p className="mb-3 text-sm" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Composure signals you have
              alternatives, you are not desperate. When you get flustered,
              apologetic, or defensive, they push harder.

                Good negotiation behaviors earn respect and de-escalate
                pressure. Bad behaviors invite more aggressive demands. After
                the session, you get detailed analysis showing exactly where you
                held firm and where you caved.

          <p className="leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
            Sarah's mistake was not that she wanted to close the deal. It was
            that she let fear drive her response. Every discount she offered
            without being asked, every term she extended without trading,
            communicated one message: I am desperate.

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#5C5C54" }}>
            The best negotiators are not aggressive. They are calm, curious, and
            prepared. They ask questions instead of arguing. They trade instead
            of giving. They stay composed when buyers push hard. These are
            skills that can be practiced.
