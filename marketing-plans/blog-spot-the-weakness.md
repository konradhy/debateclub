# Social Media Plan: Spot the Weakness

**Content Type:** Blog Post
**Primary Audience:** Professionals and critical thinkers who want to detect and counter bad logic in real-time

## Core Insight

**The ONE thing people should remember:**

"You know that feeling when someone's argument sounds wrong but you can't explain why? That's a fallacy you haven't learned to name yet. The 5 most common ones show up in 90% of arguments. Once you can spot them in real-time, people stop getting away with bad logic around you."

**Why this works:**
- Addresses a universal frustration (can't articulate why something's wrong)
- Specific number (5 fallacies, not "many")
- Implies a learnable skill (naming = detecting)
- Promise of power shift (people stop getting away with it)

```
How to call out bad logic without sounding like a jerk

You know that moment when someone says something that's clearly flawed, 
but if you call it out you'll look pedantic or aggressive?

I used to either stay quiet (frustrating) or blurt out "That's wrong" 
(equally bad). Then I learned a technique that actually works.

The problem is most people attack the person or the conclusion. What you 
should attack is the logical structure—and you can do it without seeming 
combative.

---

**The 3-Step Callout:**

1. **Name the move** (not the person)

Instead of: "You're just attacking me instead of responding"
Say: "That's an ad hominem—attacking my background rather than my point"

Naming the tactic signals you know what's happening. It puts them on notice 
without making it personal.

2. **Explain why it doesn't work**

"Whether I work for [company] doesn't make my argument true or false. 
The facts I cited are the facts regardless of who says them."

This shows the logical flaw without being preachy.

3. **Redirect to substance**

"So—would you like to address the actual argument?"

This puts the burden back on them. They either engage with your point 
or look evasive.

---

**The 5 fallacies that show up constantly:**

1. **Ad Hominem**: Attacking you instead of your argument
   Counter: "My background is irrelevant to whether the argument is true."

2. **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting your position
   Counter: "That's not what I said. I said [actual position]. Please 
   respond to that."

3. **False Dilemma**: Presenting only two options when more exist
   Counter: "Those aren't the only two choices. We could also..."

4. **Appeal to Authority**: Citing an expert outside their expertise
   Counter: "Is that person actually an expert in THIS field?"

5. **Slippery Slope**: Claiming one step leads to extreme consequences
   Counter: "Where's the evidence that chain of events will happen?"

---

The key is to stay calm and curious. You're not being a debate bro. 
You're genuinely trying to have a better conversation by pointing out 
where logic breaks down.

What trips you up most when trying to call out bad arguments?
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Opens with relatable tension (want to call out, afraid to look bad)
- ✅ Clear 3-step framework
- ✅ 5 specific fallacies with exact counter-phrases
- ✅ Tone advice (calm and curious, not combative)
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
- ✅ Zero promotional language

### Example Post 2: r/LifeProTips

**Title:** "LPT: Learn the names of the 5 most common logical fallacies. You'll suddenly notice them everywhere—and you'll stop falling for them."

```
LPT: Learn the names of the 5 most common logical fallacies. You'll 
suddenly notice them everywhere—and you'll stop falling for them.

Once I learned to name these, I started hearing them in meetings, 
on podcasts, in political debates, even in conversations with family.

The 5 that show up in 90% of arguments:

1. **Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person instead of their argument
   Example: "You only say that because you work for X"
   Reality: Where I work doesn't make my facts true or false

2. **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting your position to attack an easier target
   Example: "So you want open borders?" when you said "reform visa process"
   Reality: Those are completely different positions

3. **False Dilemma**: Only two options when more exist
   Example: "Either we cut taxes or the economy collapses"
   Reality: There are dozens of other options

4. **Appeal to Authority**: Citing expertise outside someone's field
   Example: A celebrity endorsing a medical treatment
   Reality: Being famous doesn't make you a doctor

5. **Slippery Slope**: Claiming one step inevitably leads to catastrophe
   Example: "If we allow this, next thing you know..."
   Reality: Where's the evidence that chain reaction will happen?

---

**Pro tip for calling them out:**

Don't just say "that's a fallacy." People get defensive.

Instead: Name it, explain why it doesn't work, then redirect.

"That's a straw man—that's not what I said. I said [actual position]. 
Would you like to address that?"

Calm. Direct. Non-aggressive.

Once you can name these in real-time, you stop getting steamrolled by 
people who argue in bad faith. It's life-changing for difficult 
conversations.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Classic LPT format
- ✅ 5 fallacies with clear examples
- ✅ Practical application advice
- ✅ Real-world outcome ("stop getting steamrolled")
- ✅ Bonus tip for delivery

### Engagement Plan

**Prepared Responses:**

If someone asks: "This sounds exhausting to do in real conversations"
```
"It feels that way at first, but it becomes automatic—like learning to 
spot a typo.

I started by just noticing them after conversations. 'Oh, that was a 
straw man.' Over time, I started catching them live. Now my brain 
automatically flags bad logic while people are still talking.

The payoff is you stop losing arguments to people who are actually wrong. 
That's worth the learning curve."
```

If someone asks: "Doesn't this make you annoying at parties?"
```
"Ha, fair concern. I'm not actually calling out fallacies at parties.

I use this mostly in:
- Work meetings where decisions matter
- Negotiations where someone's trying to manipulate
- Arguments where I actually care about the outcome

In casual conversation? I let stuff go. But when stakes are real, having 
this skill is a game-changer."
```

If someone says: "People who talk about 'fallacies' are usually the worst"
```
"You're right that some people use logic terms to be insufferable.

The difference is intent:
- Bad: Using fallacy names to win points and look smart
- Good: Using them to redirect to substance and have better conversation

I'm not trying to 'well actually' people. I'm trying to cut through BS 
faster. When someone straw-mans my position, I'm not going to debate a 
position I don't hold."
```

## Twitter/X Strategy

### Thread Structure (7 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
That frustrating feeling when someone's argument is obviously wrong but 
you can't explain why?

That's a fallacy you haven't learned to name yet.

Here are the 5 that show up in 90% of arguments (and how to counter each):
```

**Tweet 2 (Ad Hominem):**
```
1. Ad Hominem

Attack on YOU instead of your ARGUMENT.

"You only say that because you work for [company]"

Counter: "My background doesn't make my facts true or false. 
Address the argument, not me."

Don't take the bait. Redirect.
```

**Tweet 3 (Straw Man):**
```
2. Straw Man

Misrepresenting your position to attack an easier target.

"So you want open borders?" (when you said "visa reform")

Counter: "That's not my position. I said [X]. 
Please respond to what I actually argued."

Name the move. Reclaim your position.
```

**Tweet 4 (False Dilemma):**
```
3. False Dilemma

Only two options presented when more exist.

"Either we cut taxes or the economy collapses."

Counter: "Those aren't the only two options. 
What about [third option]?"

Break the binary. Open the frame.
```

**Tweet 5 (Appeal to Authority):**
```
4. Appeal to Authority

Citing an expert outside their expertise.

"[Celebrity] said this vaccine is dangerous."

Counter: "Is that person actually an expert in medicine? 
Their expertise is in [other field]."

Expertise doesn't transfer.
```

**Tweet 6 (Slippery Slope):**
```
5. Slippery Slope

One step leads to extreme consequences.

"If we allow this, next thing you know [catastrophe]."

Counter: "Where's the evidence that chain of events will happen?"

Demand proof for the domino theory.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```
Most people freeze when they hear bad logic.

Not because they don't sense it's wrong—
But because they can't NAME it fast enough.

Learn these 5. Practice spotting them.

You'll suddenly hear them everywhere.

And you'll stop getting steamrolled.

### Standalone Tweet Ideas

**Tweet 1 (Controversial):**
```
Hot take: You don't lose arguments because you're wrong.

You lose because you can't name the fallacy fast enough.

By the time you figure out what was flawed, they've already moved on.

Speed of detection > correctness of position
```

**Tweet 2 (Observation):**
```
Once you learn to name logical fallacies, you start hearing them 
everywhere:

→ Work meetings
→ News interviews
→ Political debates
→ Family arguments
→ Twitter threads

It's like putting on glasses for the first time.

You can't unsee it.
```

**Tweet 3 (Framework):**
```
The 3-Step Fallacy Callout:

1. Name the move
   "That's a straw man"

2. Explain the flaw
   "You're attacking a position I don't hold"

3. Redirect to substance
   "Would you like to address what I actually said?"

Calm. Direct. Non-combative.
```

**Tweet 4 (Engagement):**
```
What's the logical fallacy you see most often?

I'll start: Straw man.

People constantly misrepresent what I said so they can argue against 
something easier.

"So you're saying [thing I definitely didn't say]?"

No. No I'm not.
```

### Post Angle
**Hook Type:** Workplace Frustration + Framework

**Opening Line:**
"The meeting was going off the rails, and I couldn't figure out why."

---

### Full Post

```
The meeting was going off the rails, and I couldn't figure out why.

Someone had said something that felt wrong. I knew I disagreed. But I 
couldn't articulate what was flawed about their logic.

So I stayed quiet.

Later, walking to my car, it hit me: they had presented a false dilemma.

"Either we launch next quarter or we lose the market window."

Those weren't the only two options. There were at least three other 
approaches we could have discussed.

But the moment was gone. The decision was made.

---

I've since learned that this happens constantly in business:

Someone uses flawed logic.
We sense something's wrong.
But we can't name it fast enough.
So we stay quiet.
And bad decisions get made.

---

The fix? Learn to name the 5 most common logical fallacies in real-time.

**1. Straw Man**

They misrepresent your position to attack something easier.

→ "That's not what I said. I said [actual position]."

**2. Ad Hominem**

They attack your background instead of your argument.

→ "My background doesn't change whether the data is accurate."

**3. False Dilemma**

They present two options when more exist.

→ "What about [third option]?"

**4. Appeal to Authority**

They cite expertise outside someone's field.

→ "Is that person actually an expert in this area?"

**5. Slippery Slope**

They claim one step leads to catastrophe.

→ "What's the evidence that will actually happen?"

---

The skill isn't being pedantic.

It's being fast.

When you can name a fallacy in real-time, you can redirect the 
conversation before bad logic leads to bad decisions.

---

Since I started practicing this, meetings feel different.

Not because I call out every logical flaw.

But because when something IS flawed, I can articulate why—in the moment.

And that changes outcomes.

---

What's the fallacy you see most often in your workplace?

For me it's the false dilemma. "We have to choose between X and Y" when 
there are clearly other options.
