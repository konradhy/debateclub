## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### If Reddit Posts Flop
- **Plan B**: Different subreddits, adjust titles, test different times
- **Don't**: Spam the same post to multiple subreddits (will get banned)

### If Twitter Doesn't Gain Traction
- **Plan B**: Focus more on Reddit, reduce Twitter frequency
- **Consider**: Engaging with bigger accounts, collaboration

### If Videos Don't Perform
- **Plan B**: Reduce to quarterly instead of monthly, focus on Reddit/Twitter
- **ROI**: Videos are high effort, if not working, cut them

### If Hitting Burnout
- **Plan B**: Reduce frequency (1 Reddit post/week, fewer daily tweets)
- **Remember**: Sustainable rhythm > short-term sprint

### If Not Hitting 100 Signups by April 1
- **Analysis**: Where is funnel breaking?
  - Not enough traffic? → More posts
  - Traffic not signing up? → Website/messaging issue
  - Signups not activating? → Product/onboarding issue
- **Adjust**: Focus on the weak link, not just more volume
