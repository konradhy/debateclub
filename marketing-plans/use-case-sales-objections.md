## Core Insight

**The ONE thing people should remember:**

"Top salespeople don't have better answers to objections—they've practiced their answers more. When 'too expensive' hits, they've already heard it 50 times and their response is automatic. You're competing against people who've done the reps."

**Why this works:**
- Reframes objection handling as a practice problem, not a knowledge problem
- Implies the solution (deliberate practice, not reading scripts)
- Addresses competitive reality (you're competing against practiced reps)
- Universal sales pain point (everyone gets the same objections)
- Explains the gap between knowing and doing

### Example Post 1: r/sales

**Title:** "After 8 years in sales, here's what actually improved my close rate (it wasn't a new script)"

```
After 8 years in sales, here's what actually improved my close rate (it wasn't a new script)

Year 1-3: I had all the objection handling scripts memorized. Still froze when prospects said "it's too expensive."

Year 4-5: Started listening to call recordings. Noticed I said "um" a lot. Fixed that. Still averaged 15% close rate.

Year 6: Something changed. Close rate jumped to 28%.

What happened?

I stopped reading about objection handling and started practicing it.

---

Here's what I mean:

Before: Read script for handling "too expensive." Understood it intellectually. Got hit with "too expensive" on a call. Mind went blank. Word-vomited something about ROI. Lost the deal.

After: Practiced the "too expensive" response out loud. Did it 50 times. Got it to the point where it was automatic. Got hit with "too expensive" on a call. Response came out smooth. Closed the deal.

The difference wasn't what I knew. It was what I'd practiced.

---

Here's my current framework for the 5 objections I hear every week:

**1. "It's too expensive"**
- Don't: Immediately offer discount (you just validated their price objection)
- Do: "Compared to what?" or "What would you need to see to justify this investment?"
- The goal: Shift from price to value/ROI conversation

**2. "I need to think about it"**
- Don't: Say "okay, when can I follow up?" (you've lost control)
- Do: "What specifically are you weighing?" Then address whatever they say.
- The goal: Surface the real objection hiding behind the polite brush-off

**3. "Send me some info"**
- Don't: Send a PDF and hope they read it
- Do: "Happy to. What would be most useful for you to see?" Then book the follow-up call before you hang up.
- The goal: Turn brush-off into engagement

**4. "We're using [Competitor]"**
- Don't: Trash the competitor
- Do: "How's that going for you?" Wait for the gap. Position into the gap.
- The goal: Find dissatisfaction, don't create it

**5. "Now's not the right time"**
- Don't: Accept it at face value
- Do: "What's happening in 90 days that would change that?" or "What does waiting cost you?"
- The goal: Quantify cost of inaction

---

Here's the thing: none of this is revolutionary. You probably know all these responses already.

The question is: Can you deliver them smoothly when you're nervous, when the prospect is hostile, when you really need this deal?

That takes practice. Not reading—actual out-loud practice until the response is automatic.

What objection trips you up most? Curious what responses people have found that work.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Opens with credibility (8 years in sales, specific close rate numbers)
- ✅ Shows transformation (15% to 28%)
- ✅ Reframes problem (knowing vs. practicing)
- ✅ Provides complete framework (5 objections with specific responses)
- ✅ Acknowledges they probably know this (builds trust)
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
- ✅ Zero promotional language

### Example Post 2: r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** "I lost 37 deals before I figured out why 'too expensive' was killing me"

```
I lost 37 deals before I figured out why "too expensive" was killing me

When I started my company, I knew my product was great. The demos went well. Prospects loved what they saw.

Then they'd say: "Love it, but it's too expensive."

And I would panic.

I'd start justifying the price. List all the features. Compare to competitors. Offer discounts.

Nothing worked. Lost deal after deal after deal.

37 of them. I tracked.

---

Then I sat down with a sales coach who'd been doing this for 20 years. I told him my pitch. He nodded. Then he asked:

"When they say 'too expensive,' what do you say?"

I gave him my carefully prepared response about value and ROI.

He said: "That's fine. Now say it to me like I just said 'too expensive' and I'm annoyed and ready to hang up."

I froze. The words that sounded great in my head came out as a jumbled mess.

"That's your problem," he said. "You know the words. You haven't practiced saying them under pressure."

---

Here's what changed everything:

**The response I practice now for "too expensive":**

"Compared to what?"

That's it. Two words. And then I shut up and wait.

90% of the time, they say something like "well, Competitor X is cheaper" or "we didn't budget for this."

Now I know what I'm actually dealing with. It's not that my price is high—it's that they're comparing me to something else, or they haven't allocated budget.

From there, I can address the real objection.

---

But here's the key: I practiced that response 50 times before my next sales call.

Out loud. Not in my head.

With someone pushing back on me: "That's not an answer. Why should I pay this much?"

By the time the real objection came, I'd already handled it dozens of times. No panic. No freezing. Just: "Compared to what?" Pause. Listen.

The deal closed.

---

Since then, I've done this for every common objection:
- "I need to think about it" → "What specifically are you weighing?"
- "Send me some info" → "Happy to. What would be most useful?" (Then book follow-up)
- "We're using Competitor" → "How's that going for you?"

Same process: Practice the response out loud until it's automatic.

My close rate went from 11% to 27%. Same product. Same price. Different preparation.

---

The lesson: Knowing what to say and being able to say it under pressure are two completely different skills.

What objection costs you the most deals?
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Specific numbers hook (37 deals lost, 11% to 27%)
- ✅ Vulnerability (tracked my failures)
- ✅ Mentor story adds credibility
- ✅ Key insight is memorable ("Compared to what?")
- ✅ Clear before/after transformation
- ✅ Framework for common objections
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
- ✅ Relevant to founders who do their own sales

### Engagement Plan

**First 2 Hours After Posting:**
- Set phone reminder to check every 30 minutes
- Upvote thoughtful comments
- Reply to every question with detailed answer
- Don't link to product unless specifically asked "how did you practice?"

**Prepared Responses:**

**If someone asks: "How do you practice objection handling?"**
```
"A few things that worked for me:

1. Write out your response to the top 5 objections you hear
2. Say them out loud until they sound natural (not like you're reading)
3. Have someone throw the objection at you unexpectedly and practice responding in the moment
4. Record yourself on a call review, note where you fumbled, practice those specific moments

The key is practicing under some kind of pressure, not just rehearsing in your head.

I also use an AI tool that simulates prospects throwing objections at me—it doesn't let me off easy like a colleague might. DM me if you want the link, don't want to spam the thread."
```

**If someone shares their specific objection:**
```
"That's a tricky one. A few questions:

- When you get this objection, what do you typically say now?
- What happens after you say that?
- What do you think the prospect is actually concerned about underneath the stated objection?

Usually the stated objection isn't the real objection. 'Too expensive' often means 'I don't see the value yet' or 'I need to justify this to my boss.' 

Once you figure out what's underneath, the response becomes clearer."
```

**If someone is skeptical: "Just learn better closing techniques"**
```
"You're not wrong that technique matters. But technique without practice is just theory.

Think about it: a great basketball player might know the form for a free throw. But they've also shot 10,000 of them. When it's game time, they don't think about form—it's automatic.

Same with sales objections. You can know the perfect response to 'too expensive.' But if you freeze when it actually comes up, that knowledge doesn't help.

The top salespeople I know don't have secret scripts. They've just done more reps."
```

## Twitter/X Strategy

### Thread Structure (7 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
Top salespeople don't have better objection scripts.

They've practiced their scripts more.

"Too expensive" hits → response is automatic.

You're competing against people who've done the reps.

Here's how to catch up:
```

**Tweet 2 (The Reframe):**
```
I lost 37 deals to "too expensive" before I figured this out:

Knowing what to say ≠ being able to say it under pressure.

I had the perfect response memorized.
But when the objection hit, my mind went blank.

The fix wasn't a better script. It was more practice.
```

**Tweet 3 (The Framework - Part 1):**
```
The 5 objections you'll hear this week (and what works):

1. "Too expensive"
→ "Compared to what?"
→ Wait. They'll reveal the real objection.

2. "I need to think about it"
→ "What specifically are you weighing?"
→ Surface the real concern hiding behind the brush-off.
```

**Tweet 4 (The Framework - Part 2):**
```
3. "Send me some info"
→ "Happy to. What would be most useful?"
→ Then book the follow-up BEFORE you hang up.

4. "We're using [Competitor]"
→ "How's that going for you?"
→ Find dissatisfaction. Don't create it.
```

**Tweet 5 (The Framework - Part 3):**
```
5. "Now's not the right time"
→ "What does waiting cost you?"
→ Quantify the cost of inaction.

None of these are revolutionary.

You probably know them already.

The question: Can you deliver them smoothly when the prospect is hostile and you really need the deal?
```

**Tweet 6 (The Practice):**
```
How I practice objection handling:

1. Write out my response
2. Say it out loud 20x (not in my head)
3. Have someone throw the objection at me unexpectedly
4. Practice responding in the moment

By rep 50, it's automatic.

That's the difference between 15% and 28% close rate.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```
You're not losing deals because you don't know what to say.

You're losing them because you haven't practiced saying it under pressure.

Do the reps. Close more deals.

What objection costs you the most deals? Reply—I'll share what works.
```

**Hashtags:** #sales #objectionhandling #closingdeals

### Standalone Tweet Ideas

**Tweet 1 (Controversial):**
```
Unpopular sales opinion:

Reading objection handling scripts is basically useless.

You need REPS, not READING.

The difference between 15% and 30% close rate is practice, not knowledge.
```

**Tweet 2 (Data point):**
```
I tracked 100 lost deals.

The objections that killed them:
- "Too expensive" - 34%
- "Need to think about it" - 28%
- "Using competitor" - 19%
- "Not the right time" - 12%
- Other - 7%

Same 5 objections. Every week.

Are you practicing responses to all 5?
```

**Tweet 3 (Before/After):**
```
Before practice:

"Too expensive"
→ Me: "Well, um, we have great features and..."
→ Deal lost

After 50 reps:

"Too expensive"
→ Me: "Compared to what?"
→ *wait*
→ Real objection revealed
→ Deal closed

Same words. Different delivery.
```

**Tweet 4 (Engagement driver):**
```
Sales reps: What objection costs you the most deals?

- "Too expensive"
- "Need to think about it"
- "We're using competitor"
- "Not the right time"
- "Need to check with boss"

Reply with yours. I'll share what works.

### Full Post

```
I lost 37 deals to the same objection before I figured out what was happening.

The objection: "It's too expensive."

My response: *panic* + word salad about features and ROI.

Result: Lost deal.

Every. Single. Time.

---

Then I sat down with a sales mentor who'd been doing this for 20 years.

He asked me to pitch him. I did.

He said "too expensive."

I gave my carefully prepared response.

He shook his head.

"You know the words. You haven't practiced saying them under pressure. That's why you freeze."

---

He was right.

When I rehearsed in my head, my response sounded great.
When a real prospect hit me with the objection, I fumbled.

Knowing what to say ≠ being able to say it when it matters.

---

Here's what changed:

I started practicing objection handling like athletes practice plays.

Out loud. Not in my head.
With someone pushing back.
Until the response was automatic.

For "too expensive," my response became:

"Compared to what?"

Two words. Then silence.

90% of the time, they reveal the real objection:
→ "Competitor X is cheaper"
→ "We didn't budget for this"
→ "My boss won't approve"

Now I know what I'm actually dealing with.

---

I did this for every objection I hear weekly:

"I need to think about it"
→ "What specifically are you weighing?"

"Send me some info"
→ "Happy to. What would be most useful for you?"

"We're using [Competitor]"
→ "How's that going for you?"

"Not the right time"
→ "What does waiting cost you?"

---

After 50 practice reps on each:

Close rate went from 11% to 27%.
Same product. Same price.
Different preparation.

---

The uncomfortable truth about sales:

Top performers don't have secret scripts.
They've practiced their scripts more than you have.

When "too expensive" hits, their response is automatic.
They've already heard it 50 times.

You're competing against people who've done the reps.

## Short-Form Video Strategy (TikTok/Reels/Shorts)

### Video Concept 1: "Two Words That Changed My Close Rate"

**Hook (0-3 sec):**
[On screen, text: "I lost 37 deals to the same objection"]
[Verbal: "I lost 37 deals before I figured out this response"]

**Setup (3-15 sec):**
[Cut to talking head]
"Every time a prospect said 'too expensive,' I would panic."

[Role-play - Bad response]
"Well, um, we have really great features and the ROI is..."

[Cut back]
"Then I learned two words that changed everything."

**Payoff (15-45 sec):**
[Text: "The response?"]

"Compared to what?"

[Pause]

"That's it. Then you shut up and wait."

[Text: "Why it works:"]

"90% of the time, they say something like 'Competitor X is cheaper' or 'we didn't budget for this.'"

"Now you know what you're actually dealing with."

[Role-play - Good response]
Prospect: "It's too expensive."
You: "Compared to what?"
Prospect: "Well... our current vendor is half the price."
You: "Got it. And how's that going for you?"

[Cut back]
"See? You went from defending your price to uncovering their real concerns."

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"The difference? I practiced this response 50 times before my next call."

[Text: "Practice → Automatic → Close"]

"Link in bio for the other 5 objections."

[Left side - Before]
Prospect: "It's too expensive."
Rep: "Well, um, I understand, but you know, we have really great features and the ROI is really good and..."
[Text: Panicking. Word salad. Lost deal.]

[Right side - After]
Prospect: "It's too expensive."
Rep: "Compared to what?"
Prospect: "..."
Rep: *waits*
Prospect: "Well, our current solution is cheaper."
Rep: "Got it. And how's that working for you?"
[Text: Calm. Confident. Closed deal.]

[Cut to talking head]
"Notice the difference?"

"Left side: knows the right response, can't deliver it under pressure."

"Right side: response is automatic. No thinking. Just execution."

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"The gap between knowing and doing is practice."

[Text: "Do the reps. Close more deals."]

"Comment the objection that costs you the most deals."
