# Social Media Plan: Back It Up

**Content Type:** Blog Post
**Primary Audience:** Professionals who need to persuade with evidence (salespeople, consultants, executives, lawyers)

## Core Insight

**The ONE thing people should remember:**

"The difference between someone who talks and someone who wins is receipts. Having evidence isn't enough—it's knowing WHEN to drop it. Wait for them to commit to a denial, then produce the document. That moment of 'Well, actually, here's the proof...' is what changes minds."

**Why this works:**
- Reframes evidence as weapon, not just support
- Specific timing advice (wait for denial, then produce)
- Concrete visual (the "receipt" metaphor)
- Implies a learnable skill (timing can be practiced)

### Example Post 1: r/sales

**Title:** "When a prospect denies saying something, and you have the email saved. That moment is everything."

```
When a prospect denies saying something, and you have the email saved. That moment is everything.

Had a call last week where the prospect said "We never discussed pricing under $50k." 

I knew that was false. I had the email from 3 weeks ago. But instead of 
immediately correcting him, I paused.

"That's interesting. So just to confirm—you're saying we never talked about 
pricing in that range?"

He doubled down. "That's right. You must be confusing us with another client."

Then I said: "Would you mind if I shared something? I have our email from 
March 14th right here."

Read it aloud. Word for word. Including his exact quote about budgeting 
$45k for this quarter.

Dead silence.

He didn't just back down—he apologized. More importantly, he stopped 
negotiating against my pricing from that moment forward.

---

Here's what I've learned about using receipts in sales:

**1. Never lead with the evidence**

If I'd opened with "Actually, here's the email," he would have found a way 
to explain it away. By letting him commit to the denial FIRST, the contrast 
between his confidence and my evidence was devastating.

**2. Get them to double down**

Ask a clarifying question that makes them repeat their false claim. 
"Just to make sure I understand—you're saying X?" Now they're fully 
committed. The receipt hits harder.

**3. Cite the source specifically**

Don't say "I think you said something different." Say "I have our email 
from March 14th at 3:47pm." The precision signals that you're not bluffing.

**4. Read it aloud**

Don't paraphrase. Read the exact words. Let THEM hear what they said. 
It's harder to deny your own language.

**5. Pause after**

Don't fill the silence. Let the receipt land. They need time to process 
that they just got caught.

---

Since I started treating evidence as a weapon (not just backup), my close 
rate has improved noticeably. Prospects take me more seriously because 
they know I'm prepared.

The irony: most of the time I never have to use the receipts. They smell 
that I'm prepared and stop trying to gaslight me about what was said.

What's your best "I have the email" story? Those moments are so satisfying.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Opens with specific, relatable story
- ✅ Shows the technique in action (timing, precision)
- ✅ 5 actionable principles, not vague advice
- ✅ Business outcome (close rate improved)
- ✅ Psychological insight (preparation changes dynamics)
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
- ✅ Zero promotional language

### Example Post 2: r/consulting

**Title:** "The timing of evidence is more important than having evidence. Here's what I learned from partners who win client arguments."

```
The timing of evidence is more important than having evidence. Here's what I learned from partners who win client arguments.

Watched a partner completely shut down a client executive last month. The 
client was claiming his team had been "consistently delivering on time" 
despite our data showing otherwise.

Most consultants would immediately pull up the slide with the delivery 
metrics. But this partner did something different.

He asked: "Help me understand—when you say 'consistently,' what percentage 
on-time are you referring to?"

Client said: "Easily 85-90%."

Partner: "And that's based on your internal tracking?"

Client: "Absolutely. Our PMO reports are solid."

THEN the partner pulled up the data. "I have your PMO reports right here. 
They show 67% on-time delivery over the last 8 quarters."

The room went quiet. The client had no response. His own team's data 
contradicted him.

---

What made this work wasn't having the data. Everyone has data. It was the 
setup.

**Principle 1: Let them commit first**

If the partner had opened with the 67% stat, the client would have 
challenged the methodology or claimed special circumstances. By letting 
the client stake out a position ("85-90%"), he made the contradiction 
undeniable.

**Principle 2: Use their own sources**

The partner didn't cite external benchmarks. He cited the client's OWN 
PMO reports. You can argue with consultant data. You can't argue with your 
own documentation.

**Principle 3: Be specific**

"8 quarters" not "recent history." "67%" not "significantly lower." 
Precision signals preparation and credibility.

**Principle 4: Pause after the reveal**

The partner let the silence do the work. Didn't explain, didn't soften. 
Just let the executive sit with what happened.

**Principle 5: Don't gloat**

After the reveal, the partner immediately pivoted to "So let's talk about 
how to improve this." He won the point without making an enemy.

---

The meta-lesson: evidence without timing is just noise. Evidence with 
timing is persuasion.

The best partners I've worked with all do this. They don't lecture clients 
with data. They set traps and let clients walk into them.

What's the most effective use of evidence you've seen in a client setting?
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Authority signal (partner-level observation)
- ✅ Specific real scenario (67% vs 85-90%)
- ✅ 5 clear principles with explanation
- ✅ Shows professional skill (not gloating, pivoting to solutions)
- ✅ Memorable framework (evidence without timing = noise)
- ✅ Asks for community examples
- ✅ Consulting-appropriate language

### Engagement Plan

**First 2 Hours After Posting:**
- Set phone reminder to check every 30 minutes
- Upvote thoughtful comments
- Reply to every question with detailed answer
- Don't link to product unless specifically asked

**Prepared Responses:**

If someone asks: "How do you organize all this evidence?"
```
"A few things that work for me:

1. Save every email where someone makes a commitment or claim (I have a 
   folder literally called 'Receipts')
2. Screenshot verbal commitments if possible ('Per our call, you mentioned...')
3. Before important meetings, I review what the other party has said/written
4. I keep a running doc of key quotes with dates for big deals or projects

The organization part is actually easier than the timing part. Knowing 
WHEN to use it—that's the skill. I had to practice resisting the urge to 
immediately correct people."
```

If someone asks: "Isn't this combative? What if you damage the relationship?"
```
"Fair concern. The difference is in the execution:

Combative: 'You're wrong. Here's the proof.'
Strategic: 'Interesting. Would you mind if I shared something from our 
earlier conversation?'

The goal isn't to embarrass—it's to establish credibility. When I use 
evidence this way, I'm signaling 'I'm prepared and I pay attention.' Most 
people actually respect that.

Also: I only use this when someone is genuinely misrepresenting or trying 
to gaslight. If it's honest confusion, I just clarify without the drama. 
The technique is for bad faith situations."
```

If someone says: "This sounds paranoid"
```
"I thought so too at first. But after getting burned a few times by 
'I never said that' moments, I changed my approach.

The key is you don't NEED to use the receipts most of the time. Just 
HAVING them changes how you carry yourself. You're more confident because 
you know you have backup.

And when someone does try to rewrite history? You're ready."
```

## Twitter/X Strategy

### Thread Structure (7 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
In 2020, Mehdi Hasan asked Erik Prince about a meeting in the Seychelles.

Prince denied it ever happened.

Hasan reached for a document. Read the Mueller report aloud.

Prince's face changed.

That moment went viral.

Here's the technique behind it:
```

**Tweet 2 (The Setup):**
```
Having receipts isn't enough.

Timing is everything.

If Hasan had LED with "According to the Mueller report..."
Prince would have interrupted, deflected, explained away.

Instead, he let Prince commit to the denial FIRST.

Then dropped the evidence.

The contrast was devastating.
```

**Tweet 3 (Principle 1):**
```
Principle 1: Let them commit first

Never lead with your evidence.

Wait for them to stake out a position.

"Just to be clear—you're saying you never discussed this?"

Let them double down.

THEN produce the receipt.

The harder they commit, the harder the evidence hits.
```

**Tweet 4 (Principle 2):**
```
Principle 2: Use their own sources

The best receipts aren't YOUR documents.

They're THEIRS.

→ Their email
→ Their report
→ Their recorded statement

You can argue with external evidence.

You can't argue with your own words.
```

**Tweet 5 (Principle 3):**
```
Principle 3: Be surgical

Don't say: "I think you said something different"

Say: "I have our email from March 14th at 3:47pm. 
You wrote—and I quote—'Budget is $45k max.'"

Precision signals preparation.
Preparation signals credibility.
Credibility wins arguments.
```

**Tweet 6 (Principle 4):**
```
Principle 4: Let silence work

After you produce the receipt, STOP TALKING.

Don't explain.
Don't soften.
Don't fill the silence.

Let them sit with what just happened.

The pause is where minds change.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```
Erik Prince had to sit there on live TV while Mehdi Hasan read his own 
meeting from a federal document.

That's what happens when you lie to someone who has receipts.

And knows when to use them.

### Standalone Tweet Ideas

**Tweet 1 (Story):**
```
Prospect: "We never discussed anything under $50k"

Me: "Just to confirm—that's your recollection?"

Him: "Absolutely."

Me: "I have our email from March 14th..."

*reads it aloud*

Dead silence.

The conversation changed after that.

Receipts. Have them. Know when to use them.
```

**Tweet 2 (Controversial):**
```
Hot take: Most people lose arguments not because they're wrong

But because they don't have proof.

And when they DO have proof, they use it wrong.

Leading with evidence = weakens it
Waiting for denial, then producing = devastating

Timing > Having
```

**Tweet 3 (Framework):**
```
The Receipt Timing Framework:

1. Let them make the claim
2. Ask a clarifying question
3. Let them commit harder
4. Produce the evidence
5. Cite it specifically (date, exact words)
6. Read it aloud
7. Pause

90% of people skip steps 1-3 and wonder why it doesn't land.
```

**Tweet 4 (Engagement):**
```
What's your best "I have the receipt" story?

That moment when someone claims X, and you pull up the email/text/document 
that proves the opposite.

I'll start: Prospect denied ever seeing my proposal. I screenshared his 
calendar—showing 30 minutes blocked for "Review [my name]'s proposal."
```

### Post Angle
**Hook Type:** Famous Moment + Framework

**Opening Line:**
"The moment that ended Erik Prince's credibility on live television took exactly 14 seconds."

### Full Post

```
The moment that ended Erik Prince's credibility on live television took 
exactly 14 seconds.

In 2020, journalist Mehdi Hasan asked Prince about a meeting in the 
Seychelles. Prince denied it happened.

Then Hasan reached for a document.

He didn't argue. Didn't accuse. Just read the relevant passage from the 
Mueller report. Out loud. Word for word.

Prince's face changed. The clip went viral.

---

That 14-second moment wasn't luck. It was technique.

Most people would have LED with the evidence:

"According to the Mueller report, you met with..."

Prince would have interrupted, challenged, deflected.

But Hasan did something different:

He let Prince commit to the denial FIRST.

Then produced the receipt.

The contrast between Prince's confident denial and Hasan's documented 
proof was devastating.

---

I've started using this approach in business conversations. Not to 
embarrass people, but to establish credibility.

Here's the framework:

**1. Never lead with evidence**

Wait for them to make their claim. Let them commit.

**2. Ask a clarifying question**

"Just so I understand—you're saying X?"

This makes them double down on the position you're about to disprove.

**3. Cite specifically**

Not "I think we discussed something different."

But: "I have our email from March 14th at 3:47pm."

Precision signals preparation.

**4. Read it aloud**

Don't paraphrase. Quote the exact words. Let them hear what they said.

**5. Pause after**

Let silence do the work. Don't explain. Don't soften.

---

Since I started treating evidence as a strategic asset (not just backup), 
conversations changed.

People take me more seriously because they know I'm prepared.

And ironically, I rarely need to USE the receipts anymore. They sense 
the preparation and stop trying to rewrite history.
