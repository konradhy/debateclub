# Customer Discovery: How to Learn What Customers Actually Need Before You Build

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

## The Problem

You have an idea. You're convinced it solves a real problem. Your friends think it's brilliant. Your co-founder is excited. You've sketched wireframes and projected revenue.

Then you talk to potential customers. And one of two things happens:

1. **They love it** (politely) – "That's really interesting! Let me know when it's ready." Then they never respond to your follow-ups.

2. **You pitch them** – You spend 20 minutes explaining your vision. They nod along. You walk away thinking you validated your idea. You build it. Nobody buys it.

The problem isn't your idea. **The problem is you're doing customer discovery wrong.**

You're asking hypothetical questions ("Would you use this?"), pitching your solution instead of understanding their problem, and accepting polite enthusiasm as validation. None of that predicts whether someone will actually pay.

## Why This Matters

- **42% of startups fail because they build something nobody wants** (CB Insights analysis of 101 startup failures)
- **Most founders spend 6-12 months building** before realizing they misunderstood the problem
- **"Would you buy this?" question has near-zero predictive value** – people say yes to be polite, not because they'll actually buy (The Mom Test)
- **10-20 good customer discovery interviews** can save you months of wasted development time

Customer discovery isn't a step you complete once. It's the foundational skill that determines whether you build something people pay for or something that dies in an MVP graveyard.

And here's the hard truth: **Most founders are terrible at it.** They pitch when they should listen. They ask about the future when they should ask about the past. They leave interviews with false confidence and build the wrong thing.

## What You'll Practice

Skills that map to the 4 score categories:

1. **Problem Focus** – Keeping the conversation on their problems, not your solution
2. **Specificity** – Asking about past events, not hypothetical futures
3. **Discovery Depth** – Digging beneath surface answers to find root causes
4. **Validation Quality** – Seeking concrete evidence, not accepting compliments

## The Techniques (Research-Based)

### 1. "Tell me about the last time that happened"

**What it is:** Grounding questions in specific past events instead of hypothetical futures.

**Why it works:** People lie about what they'll do. They don't lie about what they've done. "Last time" reveals workflows, tools used, money spent, and real constraints (Fitzpatrick, The Mom Test).

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "Would you pay for a tool that does X?"
- ✅ Good: "Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem. What did you do?"

### 2. Ask About the Problem, Not Your Solution

**What it is:** Focusing 100% of the conversation on understanding their world – never mentioning your product.

**Why it works:** The moment you pitch, you bias the interview. They'll tell you what they think you want to hear. Real discovery happens when you're genuinely curious about their life (Blank, Customer Development).

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "We're building a tool that helps with X. Would this solve your problem?"
- ✅ Good: "What's the hardest part about [doing X]? How are you dealing with it now?"

### 3. "How are you solving it now?"

**What it is:** Understanding their current workarounds, tools, and spend.

**Why it works:** If they're spending $100/month on a janky workaround, you know they'll pay for a real solution. If they've never tried to solve it, it's not a real problem (Fitzpatrick, The Mom Test).

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "How much would you pay for this?"
- ✅ Good: "What are you using now? What does that cost you in time and money?"

### 4. "Why was this hard?"

**What it is:** Asking "Why?" 2-3 times to dig beneath surface-level complaints.

**Why it works:** The first answer is always superficial ("It's annoying"). The third "why" reveals the real stakes – budget impact, competitive pressure, career risk (Alvarez, Lean Customer Development).

**Example:**
- Surface: "The current tool is slow."
- One why deeper: "Why is that a problem?" → "It wastes time."
- Two whys deeper: "Why does that matter?" → "Because we lose deals when we can't respond fast enough."

### 5. Seek Commitment, Not Compliments

**What it is:** Testing whether they'll invest time, money, or reputation – not just give you praise.

**Why it works:** "That's a great idea!" is free. Commitment costs something. Real validation comes from sacrifice (Fitzpatrick, The Mom Test).

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: Accepting "I'd definitely use that!" as validation
- ✅ Good: "Would you introduce me to two others with this problem? Can we schedule a follow-up to show you a prototype?"

### 6. Interview Recent Buyers, Not Active Shoppers

**What it is:** Talking to people who recently solved the problem (bought a solution), not people currently researching.

**Why it works:** Shoppers haven't committed. They're exploring. Buyers have made decisions – they reveal what actually drove them to purchase (LEANFoundry, Common Mistakes).

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "I'm looking for people interested in project management tools" (finds shoppers)
- ✅ Good: "I'm looking for people who recently switched project management tools" (finds buyers)

## How the Practice Engine Works

**Opening Dynamics:**

The practice opens with realistic customer discovery scenarios:

- "Sure, I have a few minutes. What did you want to talk about?" (Slightly guarded – you need to build rapport)
- "I got your message. So you mentioned wanting to learn about [problem area]?" (Professional but non-committal)
- "I've done a few of these startup interviews before – are you going to pitch me something?" (Mildly skeptical – tests if you can stay focused on them)

Each opening tests whether you'll fall into pitching mode or genuinely explore their world.

**Behavioral Rules:**

The AI prospect follows realistic customer discovery dynamics:

- **If you pitch your solution:** They become polite but vague. "That sounds interesting!" (But won't commit to anything concrete). This mirrors how real prospects react when they feel sold to.

- **If you ask hypothetical questions** ("Would you buy this?"): They give you optimistic lies. "Probably!" (But their enthusiasm means nothing). Real prospects say yes to be nice, not because they'll buy.

- **If you ask about specific past events:** They become detailed and concrete. They share workflows, tool names, exact costs, time wasted. This is the signal you're doing discovery right.

- **If you dig deeper with "why":** They reveal layers. First answer is surface-level ("It's annoying"), second answer is practical ("It wastes time"), third answer is the real motivation ("We lose deals because of it").

- **If you accept surface-level answers:** They stay at surface level. No deeper insights emerge.

- **If you seek commitment:** They either demonstrate real interest (offering intros, scheduling follow-ups) or reveal it's not a priority (hedging, going vague).

**What Gets Measured:**

- **Problem Focus (1-10):** Did you keep the conversation on their problems, or did you pitch your solution?

- **Specificity (1-10):** Did you ask about past events ("last time"), or hypothetical futures ("would you")?

- **Discovery Depth (1-10):** Did you dig beneath surface answers with "why," or accept the first thing they said?

- **Validation Quality (1-10):** Did you seek concrete evidence (current spend, past attempts, willingness to commit), or accept enthusiasm?

## Success Looks Like

A successful customer discovery interview:

1. **You never mention your solution** – The entire conversation is about their world
2. **You ask about the past** – "Last time," "what happened," "what did you try"
3. **You dig 2-3 levels deep** – First answer → "Why?" → Second answer → "Why?" → Real motivation
4. **You uncover current spend** – What they're paying now (time or money) for workarounds
5. **You test commitment** – Request intros, follow-up time, or other concrete investment

The goal isn't to get them excited about your idea. It's to **learn whether the problem is real, urgent, and worth solving.**

## Common Mistakes

These are encoded as "punish" rules in the practice engine – do these and the AI prospect will go vague, polite, or non-committal:

1. **Pitching your solution** – The moment you explain your idea, you've ruined the interview. They'll tell you what you want to hear.

2. **Asking hypothetical questions** – "Would you buy this?" "Do you think it's a good idea?" These questions produce lies.

3. **Accepting surface-level answers** – If they say "It's annoying" and you move on, you've learned nothing. Ask why it matters.

4. **Talking more than 40%** – Discovery is about listening. If you're doing most of the talking, you're not learning.

5. **Accepting "That's interesting!"** – Enthusiasm without commitment is worthless. Push for something concrete.

6. **Interviewing people who haven't acted** – If they haven't tried to solve the problem yet, it's not urgent enough to pay for.

## Real-World Applications

- **Pre-product founders** validating whether an idea is worth building
- **Product managers** deciding what to build next
- **Founders searching for product-market fit** – understanding why current users signed up
- **B2B founders** understanding buying processes and decision-makers
- **Anyone interviewing potential customers** before committing resources to development

## Notes for Implementation

### Voice & Tone
The prospect should sound like a real busy professional – not hostile, not overly enthusiastic. Slightly guarded at first, warming up when the founder asks good questions about their experience.

### Key Behavioral Triggers
- **Opens up:** When asked about specific past experiences
- **Gets detailed:** When asked "how are you solving it now?"
- **Reveals layers:** When asked "why" repeatedly
- **Goes vague:** When pitched a solution
- **Gives fake enthusiasm:** When asked hypothetical questions
- **Tests commitment:** Shows hesitation when asked for intros/time if problem isn't real

### Differentiation from Other Scenarios
- **Early Customer Sales** is about selling when you have a product but no traction
- **Customer Discovery** is about learning BEFORE you build (or to understand why people buy)
- Customer Discovery should feel like you're a researcher genuinely trying to understand their world
- There should be ZERO selling in a good discovery interview
