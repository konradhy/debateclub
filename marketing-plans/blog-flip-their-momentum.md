## Core Insight

**The ONE thing people should remember:**

"In judo, the best throws use the opponent's force against them. In arguments, the same principle applies: when someone attacks your weakest point, don't defend it. AGREE with them, then redirect. 'You're right, AND that's exactly why...' Concession isn't surrender—it's a setup for your strongest move."

**Why this works:**
- Counterintuitive (conceding sounds like losing)
- Physical metaphor (judo) is memorable and visual
- Specific technique ("You're right, AND...")
- Reframes weakness as strategy

### Example Post 1: r/negotiation

**Title:** "The 'judo move' that changed how I handle objections: agree with the attack, then redirect"

```
The "judo move" that changed how I handle objections: agree with the attack, then redirect

I used to defend every objection. "No, that's not true because..." or 
"Actually, if you look at it this way..."

It rarely worked. The other side would dig in. I'd dig in. Nobody moved.

Then I learned a technique from a mentor that felt completely backwards:

When someone attacks your weakest point, AGREE with them.

Then redirect.

---

**Here's how it works:**

Prospect: "Your price is 30% higher than competitors."

Old me: "Well, if you factor in the support and implementation..." 
(Defensive. They tune out.)

New me: "You're absolutely right. We're more expensive."

(Pause. Let that land.)

"And that's exactly why our clients stay for 5+ years while our 
competitors have 40% annual churn. The question is whether you want 
the cheapest option or the one that's still working in 3 years."

---

**Why this works:**

1. **Agreeing disarms them**
   They came ready for a fight. You don't give them one. The tension 
   deflates immediately.

2. **It builds credibility**
   When you acknowledge their point, you look fair-minded. Not 
   defensive. Not slippery. Just honest.

3. **It redirects to YOUR frame**
   You concede the ground you were going to lose anyway, then 
   immediately move to ground where you're strong.

4. **It uses their momentum**
   Like judo. They push forward with the attack. You step aside and 
   let their force carry them where YOU want them.

---

**The formula:**

"You're right. [Concede the point.] AND that's exactly why [redirect 
to your strength]."

Examples:

"You're right, I'm young. And that's exactly why I'm not stuck doing 
things the old way that stopped working."

"You're right, this is new. And that's exactly why there's still an 
opportunity—before everyone catches on."

"You're right, we're smaller. And that's exactly why you'll be 
talking to the CEO instead of ticket support."

---

The key insight: You're not actually giving anything away. You're 
conceding ground that costs you nothing, then immediately pivoting 
to ground where you win.

Most people fight for every inch. That makes them look defensive and 
burns goodwill. Strategic concession makes you look reasonable AND 
moves the conversation where you want it.

What objections do you struggle to redirect? I'm curious what others 
are dealing with.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Opens with personal story
- ✅ Clear before/after contrast
- ✅ Specific formula with multiple examples
- ✅ Explains the psychology (judo metaphor)
- ✅ Ends with engagement question

### Example Post 2: r/sales

**Title:** "The phrase that turns price objections into closes: 'You're right, and that's exactly why...'"

```
The phrase that turns price objections into closes: "You're right, and that's exactly why..."

Every salesperson knows the "we're too expensive" objection. Most of 
us have learned to defend:

"Well, if you consider the ROI..."
"Our implementation is included..."
"The TCO is actually lower..."

But defending price almost never works. The prospect has already 
anchored on "expensive." Everything you say sounds like spin.

There's a better approach.

---

**The technique:**

Prospect: "Your competitor is 40% cheaper."

You: "You're right. We're more expensive."

(Pause. Let them register that you're not fighting.)

"And that's exactly why our customers renew at 90% vs industry 
average of 60%. They pay more upfront because they don't have to 
re-implement in 18 months."

---

**Why this works:**

1. **You're not defending**
   Defending sounds like you're hiding something. Agreeing sounds 
   like confidence.

2. **You redirect to VALUE, not cost**
   "Expensive" is about cost. "Renewal rate" is about value. You 
   just changed the conversation.

3. **You make them argue against themselves**
   Now if they want the cheap option, they have to justify choosing 
   higher churn. That's uncomfortable.

---

**More examples:**

"You're right, we're a smaller company. And that's exactly why your 
implementation will be handled by our founders, not a junior rep."

"You're right, this is a new product. And that's exactly why you'll 
be our highest-priority customer, not ticket #47 in the queue."

"You're right, our competitor has more features. And that's exactly 
why they also have 100-page user manuals and 6-week onboarding."

---

**The formula:**

"You're right. [Their objection.] AND that's exactly why [your 
advantage reframed as the solution to their concern]."

The magic is the word AND. Not BUT. Not HOWEVER.

"You're right BUT" = defensive.
"You're right AND" = confident redirect.

Practice this until it's automatic. It's changed more calls for me 
than any closing technique.

What objections are you struggling to redirect?
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Speaks directly to sales pain (price objections)
- ✅ Clear formula with "AND vs BUT" insight
- ✅ Multiple industry-agnostic examples
- ✅ Positions as skill to practice

---

### Engagement Plan

**Prepared Responses:**

If someone asks: "Doesn't agreeing make you look weak?"
```
"That's what I thought at first too. But the opposite is true.

Defensiveness signals insecurity. 'No, that's not true because...' 
sounds like you're worried they might be right.

Agreeing signals confidence. 'You're right, and...' sounds like you're 
not threatened by their point because you have a bigger picture.

The key is the immediate redirect. You're not just agreeing and 
stopping there. You're agreeing and THEN pivoting to your strength."
```

If someone says: "What if the weakness is actually a real problem?"
```
"Great question. This technique only works for things that CAN be 
reframed.

If your product is genuinely broken, don't try to judo your way out. 
Fix the product.

But most objections are perception issues, not real issues:
- 'Too expensive' = value isn't understood yet
- 'Too new' = stability concerns, not actual problems
- 'Too small' = attention concerns, not capability

Those are reframe-able. A genuine product failure is not."
```

## Twitter/X Strategy

### Thread Structure (7 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
In judo, the best throws use the opponent's force against them.

The opponent pushes forward.
You step aside.
They throw themselves.

The same principle wins arguments.

Here's the technique:
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
```
Most people defend every objection.

"No, that's not true because..."
"Actually, if you look at..."

But defending rarely works.

The other side digs in.
You dig in.
Nobody moves.

There's a better approach:
```

**Tweet 3 (The Technique):**
```
When someone attacks your weakest point:

1. AGREE with them
2. REDIRECT to your strength

"You're right. We're more expensive."

(pause)

"And that's exactly why our customers stay for 5+ years while 
competitors have 40% churn."

Concession + pivot.
```

**Tweet 4 (Why It Works):**
```
Why does agreeing work better than defending?

→ Disarms them (they came for a fight)
→ Builds credibility (you look honest)
→ Redirects to YOUR frame
→ Uses their momentum against them

They push. You step aside. Their force carries them where you want.
```

**Tweet 5 (The Formula):**
```
The formula:

"You're right. [Their objection.] AND that's exactly why [your 
advantage]."

Not BUT. Not HOWEVER.

"You're right BUT" = defensive
"You're right AND" = confident redirect

That one word changes everything.
```

**Tweet 6 (Examples):**
```
Examples:

"You're right, I'm young. AND that's exactly why I'm not stuck in 
old thinking."

"You're right, we're smaller. AND that's exactly why you talk to 
the CEO, not ticket support."

"You're right, it's new. AND that's exactly why there's still 
opportunity."
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```
You're not giving anything away.

You're conceding ground that costs you nothing.
Then immediately pivoting to ground where you win.

Judo. In arguments.

### Standalone Tweet Ideas

**Tweet 1 (Controversial):**
```
Counterintuitive truth about arguments:

Defending makes you look weak.
Agreeing makes you look strong.

"You're right. We're more expensive. And that's exactly why our 
customers stay for 5 years."

Confidence isn't fighting for every inch.
It's choosing which ground matters.
```

**Tweet 2 (Observation):**
```
The best negotiators I've watched never defend.

They agree → then redirect.

"You're right, and here's why that's actually an advantage..."

It's judo. Use their force against them.

Simple technique. Rarely practiced.
```

**Tweet 3 (Framework):**
```
The Judo Redirect Framework:

1. Accept their premise
   "You're right, we ARE expensive"

2. Use "AND" not "BUT"
   AND keeps momentum. BUT creates resistance.

3. Redirect to your strength
   "...and that's exactly why our churn is half the industry"

Concede → Redirect → Win
```

## LinkedIn Strategy

### Full Post

```
I watched a partner completely defuse an objection that would have 
killed the deal.

The client said: "Your team is too junior. We expected partners on 
this engagement."

Most consultants would defend:
"Our associates are top talent..."
"They'll be supervised by senior staff..."

Defensive. Unpersuasive.

This partner did something different.

She said: "You're right. Our associates are younger than what you 
usually see."

(Pause. Client leaned in.)

"And that's exactly why they'll be spending 80 hours a week on your 
project instead of 10. The partners at other firms bill you for 
their time but delegate to juniors anyway. We just don't pretend 
otherwise."

The client nodded. We won the work.

---

I've been studying this technique because it comes up everywhere.

In judo, the best throws use the opponent's force against them. 
They push forward. You step aside. Their momentum throws them.

Arguments work the same way.

When someone attacks your weakest point:
- Defending makes you look insecure
- Agreeing makes you look confident
- Redirecting moves the conversation to ground you choose

---

The formula:

"You're right. [Concede their point.] AND that's exactly why 
[redirect to your advantage]."

Not BUT. Not HOWEVER.

"You're right BUT" = defensive
"You're right AND" = confident redirect

---

Examples:

"You're right, we're more expensive. And that's exactly why our 
customers stay for 5+ years."

"You're right, we're a smaller firm. And that's exactly why you'll 
be our priority, not another number."

"You're right, this is new. And that's exactly why there's still 
market opportunity."

---

The key insight: You're not giving anything away.

You're conceding ground you were going to lose anyway.
Then immediately pivoting to ground where you win.

Most people fight for every inch and burn goodwill.

Strategic concession makes you look reasonable AND moves the 
conversation where you want it.

What objections do you struggle to redirect? I'm collecting examples.

## Short-Form Video Strategy

### Video Concept 1: "The Judo Move"

**Hook (0-3 sec):**
[Text: "How to win arguments by AGREEING"]
[Verbal: "The best way to win an argument is to agree with them."]

**Setup (3-15 sec):**
"Sounds backwards, right? But here's what happens when you defend:"
[Text: "❌ They dig in. You dig in. Nobody moves."]

"There's a better technique. It's called the judo move."

**Payoff (15-45 sec):**
"When they attack your weakest point, AGREE. Then redirect."

[Role play]
**Prospect:** "You're too expensive."
**You:** "You're right. We're more expensive."
[Pause]
"And that's exactly why our customers stay for 5 years while 
competitors have 40% churn."

[Cut to talking head]
"See what happened? I agreed with their attack. Then used their 
momentum to pivot to MY advantage."

[Text: "Agree → Redirect → Win"]

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"The magic word is AND, not BUT. 'You're right AND...' keeps 
momentum. 'You're right BUT...' creates resistance."

[Text: "AND > BUT"]
"Link in bio for more examples."

### Video Concept 2: "The AND vs BUT"

**Hook (0-3 sec):**
[Text: "One word changes everything"]
[Verbal: "One word is the difference between losing and winning 
objections."]

**Setup (3-15 sec):**
"When someone objects to something, most people say:"
[Text: "You're right, BUT..."]
"That sounds defensive."

**Payoff (15-45 sec):**
"Replace BUT with AND."

"You're right, we're expensive. AND that's exactly why our 
customers stay for 5 years."

"You're right, I'm young. AND that's exactly why I'm not stuck 
in old thinking."

[Cut to talking head]
"BUT creates resistance. AND creates momentum."

[Text: "BUT = Defensive. AND = Confident."]

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"Try it in your next difficult conversation. Agree, then redirect."
