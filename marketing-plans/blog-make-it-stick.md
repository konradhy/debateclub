## 1. Core Insight & Hook

### The Viral-Worthy Core Insight

**"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I came, I saw, I conquered. Government of the people, by the people, for the people. The most memorable phrases in history come in threes. This is not coincidence. It's cognitive science."**

The Rule of Three is a rhetorical principle dating back to Aristotle. The human brain is wired to find patterns in threes—two feels incomplete, four feels cluttered. Three is the magic number for retention, rhythm, and impact.

### Platform-Specific Hook Angles

| Platform | Primary Hook | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Reddit | "The brain holds 3-4 items in working memory. Here's how great speakers exploit that." | Science + practical application |
| Twitter/X | "Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. I came, I saw, I conquered. See the pattern?" | Famous examples + recognition |
| LinkedIn | "Why the world's best communicators structure everything in threes" | Professional development + authority |
| Short-Form | "Lincoln, Jefferson, and Caesar all used this technique 👀" | Historical authority + curiosity |

### The "Aha Moment" to Communicate

Most people ramble through five or six points, and the audience forgets all of them. The Rule of Three creates a pattern the brain locks onto—a rhythm the audience can follow and anticipate. Three points stick where ten points blur together.

#### Post 1: r/LifeProTips - The Practical Tip

**Title:** "LPT: When making an argument, use exactly three points. Your brain literally can't remember more."

**Body:**

Working memory—the mental scratchpad you use to hold information while processing it—can handle roughly 3-4 items at a time. This is why phone numbers are chunked. It's why lists of five points blur together.

The greatest speakers in history understood this intuitively:

- "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"
- "I came, I saw, I conquered"
- "Government of the people, by the people, for the people"
- "Friends, Romans, countrymen"

Three creates a pattern the brain locks onto. Two feels incomplete. Four feels cluttered. Three is the magic number.

---

**How to apply this:**

**Opening a presentation:**
❌ "I want to cover six topics today..."
✅ "I want to show you three things: the problem, the solution, and the result."

**Making an argument:**
❌ "This policy has many issues—costs, timeline, implementation, political obstacles, environmental concerns..."
✅ "This policy fails on three fronts: it's unaffordable, unworkable, and unnecessary."

**Closing a pitch:**
❌ Long summary of everything you covered
✅ "Remember three things: the market is massive, the timing is perfect, and we're the team to do it."

---

**Why three works:**

1. **Pattern recognition:** Three is the minimum needed to establish a pattern. Once the brain detects a pattern, it locks in.

2. **Working memory:** 3-4 items is the limit. More than that and you start forgetting earlier points.

3. **Rhythmic satisfaction:** The audience anticipates the third beat. When it arrives, there's a sense of completion.

---

This is called the "Rule of Three" and it's been used since Aristotle. Next time you're making a point, ask yourself: can I structure this as three things?

---

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Share examples of famous triads in comments
- Explain the "two feels incomplete, four feels cluttered" psychology
- Note that this applies to writing, speaking, and even design

#### Post 2: r/publicspeaking - The Technique Breakdown

**Title:** "The technique Lincoln, Jefferson, and Caesar all used (and why it works)"

**Body:**

"Government of the people, by the people, for the people."
"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"I came, I saw, I conquered."

These are three of the most memorable phrases in Western history. And they all share the same structure: triads.

This is called the Rule of Three, and it's one of the most powerful rhetorical techniques available.

---

**Why three works:**

The human brain has limited working memory—roughly 3-4 items at a time. When you present more than that, the audience starts forgetting earlier points. Three maximizes impact without overload.

Additionally, three creates rhythm. The audience anticipates the third beat, and when it arrives, there's psychological satisfaction. The argument feels complete.

---

**Where to apply it:**

**Opening statements:**
"Today I want to show you three things: first, the problem is real. Second, it's getting worse. Third, we can fix it."

**Argument structure:**
Build your case on three pillars. Each should be strong enough to stand alone but more powerful together.

**Adjective stacks:**
"This policy is reckless, short-sighted, and dangerous." Three adjectives hit harder than two and stick better than four.

**Closing summaries:**
"Remember: it's real, it's urgent, and we can win." Give the audience a triad to carry out the door.

---

**Classic triad templates:**

- **Problem-Solution-Result:** What's wrong, what we should do, what happens when we do it.
- **Past-Present-Future:** Where we were, where we are, where we're going.
- **Head-Heart-Hand:** The logical case, the emotional case, the call to action.

---

**Before and after:**

Before (rambling): "This policy has many problems. There are cost issues, implementation challenges, timeline concerns, environmental issues, political obstacles..."

After (Rule of Three): "This policy fails on three fronts. It's unaffordable. It's unworkable. It's unnecessary."

The second version is not just shorter—it's more memorable. The audience can repeat "unaffordable, unworkable, unnecessary" hours later.

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"I came, I saw, I conquered."
"Government of the people, by the people, for the people."

See the pattern?

Here's why the most memorable phrases in history come in threes 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The Rule of Three is one of the oldest rhetorical principles—it dates back to Aristotle.

The brain is wired to find patterns in threes.

Two feels incomplete.
Four feels cluttered.
Three is the magic number.

**Tweet 3:**
Working memory holds roughly 3-4 items at a time.

When you present five points, the audience starts forgetting the first ones before you finish.

Three maximizes impact without overload.

**Tweet 4:**
Three also creates rhythm.

The audience anticipates the third beat.

When it arrives, there's psychological satisfaction—the argument feels complete.

That's why triads feel conclusive in a way lists don't.

**Tweet 5:**
How to apply this:

OPENING:
"I'll show you three things: the problem, the solution, the result."

ARGUMENT:
"This policy is unaffordable, unworkable, and unnecessary."

CLOSING:
"Remember: it's real, it's urgent, and we can win."

**Tweet 6:**
Classic triad templates:

• Problem-Solution-Result
• Past-Present-Future
• Head-Heart-Hand (logic, emotion, action)
• Three Adjectives
• Three Questions

Pick a pattern. Let it carry your points home.

**Tweet 7:**
Lincoln, Jefferson, Caesar, Churchill—all master communicators.

All structured their most memorable phrases in threes.

It's not coincidence. It's cognitive science.

Make it clear. Make it rhythmic. Make it stick.
