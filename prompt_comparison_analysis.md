# ARGUMENT_FRAMES_PROMPT: Current vs. Improved Comparison

## Side-by-Side Analysis of Key Changes

### 1. FRAME CATEGORIZATION APPROACH

#### ❌ CURRENT (Rigid Categories)
```
## REQUIRED FRAMES (generate 6-10 total)
Generate MULTIPLE arguments within each category when appropriate:

- **Moral/Ethical Frames** (2-3 arguments): 
  - Rights-based arguments (individual rights, civil liberties)
  - Justice-based arguments (fairness, equality)
  - Values-based arguments (tradition, progress, freedom)
  
- **Practical/Consequentialist Frames** (2-3 arguments):
  - Effectiveness arguments (what works, outcomes)
  - Safety/security arguments
  - Quality of life arguments
  
- **Economic Frames** (1-2 arguments):
  - Cost-benefit arguments
  - Market/incentive arguments
  - Resource allocation arguments
  
- **Historical/Precedent Frames** (1-2 arguments):
  - Lessons from history
  - International comparisons
  - Precedent and tradition
```

#### ✅ IMPROVED (Flexible Triadic Structures)
```
### STEP 2: TRIADIC STRUCTURE SELECTION
Choose triadic frameworks based on audience type and emotional foundation:

**For Business/Corporate Audiences**:
- Risk/Opportunity/Competitive Advantage
- Cost/Efficiency/Growth  
- Short-term/Medium-term/Long-term
- Problem/Solution/ROI

**For General Public**:
- Personal Impact/Community Impact/Future Impact
- Safety/Prosperity/Freedom
- Past Lessons/Present Reality/Future Possibility
- Problem/Solution/Benefit

**For Academic/Expert Audiences**:
- Theoretical/Empirical/Practical
- Cause/Effect/Implication
- Historical Context/Current Evidence/Future Projections
- Principle/Precedent/Policy
```

**Why This Matters**: Hasan's "Rule of Three" is about natural triadic flow, not forced categories. The improved version adapts structure to audience and context, making arguments feel more organic and persuasive.

---

### 2. EMOTIONAL FOUNDATION APPROACH

#### ❌ CURRENT (Emotion as Afterthought)
```json
{
  "emotionalCore": "[What emotion should the audience feel? Fear, hope, outrage, pride?]"
}
```
*Emotion mentioned only in output requirements*

#### ✅ IMPROVED (Emotion-First Process)
```
### STEP 1: EMOTIONAL FOUNDATION
Before generating logical structures, identify:

**Audience Emotional Triggers**:
- What does THIS audience fear most? (Security, change, loss of control, unfairness)
- What does THIS audience hope for? (Progress, stability, opportunity, justice)
- What makes THIS audience angry? (Waste, injustice, incompetence, deception)

**Issue Emotional Stakes**:
- **Risk Stakes**: What happens if we do nothing?
- **Opportunity Stakes**: What becomes possible if we act?
- **Timing Stakes**: Why is this moment critical?
```

**Why This Matters**: Hasan's core principle is "Pathos beats logos almost every time." The improved version makes emotional foundation the starting point, not an afterthought.

---

### 3. DEPLOYMENT TECHNIQUE INTEGRATION

#### ❌ CURRENT (Separate Techniques Section)
```
## DEPLOYMENT TECHNIQUES (from Hasan Chapters 3 & 8)
When deploying argument frames in debate dialogue, use these proven techniques:

**1. CONCESSION PIVOT (Synchoresis)** - Hasan Ch 8: "Judo Moves"
- **What**: Acknowledge a valid aspect of opponent's position, then redirect to your stronger point
- **Why it works**: [explanation]
- **Pattern**: "You're right that [valid point]. But what you're missing is [your counter]."
```
*Taught as separate section to apply afterward*

#### ✅ IMPROVED (Built-In Integration)
```
### STEP 3: PREEMPTIVE INTEGRATION
Build anticipated counter-arguments into frame structure:
- Identify opponent's 2-3 strongest objections to this frame
- Address them within the argument flow, not as separate rebuttals
- Use concession pivots: "Yes, [valid concern], but [stronger point]"

"builtInPreemption": {
  "anticipatedCounter": "[Opponent's likely objection]",
  "preemptiveResponse": "[How this frame addresses it]",
  "concessionPivot": "[Specific 'Yes, but...' formulation]"
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Hasan's judo moves work best when integrated into argument construction, not applied as separate techniques. The improved version builds deployment strategy into frame DNA.

### 4. AUDIENCE ADAPTATION DEPTH

#### ❌ CURRENT (Generic Audience Consideration)
```
## USING THE STRATEGIC BRIEF
- If audience context was provided, prioritize frames that will resonate with THAT specific audience's values and concerns
```
*Mentions audience but doesn't provide specific guidance*

#### ✅ IMPROVED (Audience-Specific Frame Generation)
```
## FRAME VARIETY REQUIREMENTS
- Generate frames for at least 2 different audience types
- Include at least 2 different triadic structures
- Vary emotional appeals (fear, hope, outrage, pride, urgency)

"audienceResonance": "[Why this specific audience will respond to this frame]"
```

**Why This Matters**: Hasan emphasizes "Present arguments in a way that aligns with the audience's interests or identities." The improved version requires specific audience adaptation, not just generic consideration.

---

### 5. STAKES EMPHASIS

#### ❌ CURRENT (Missing Stakes Focus)
*No specific guidance on stakes activation*

#### ✅ IMPROVED (Stakes-Driven Framing)
```
### 5. **STAKES ACTIVATION** (Throughout Hasan's work)
- Every frame must answer: "What's at risk?" and "What's possible?"
- Show consequences of inaction and benefits of action
- Create urgency through timing and opportunity

"stakes": {
  "risk": "[What's at risk if we don't act]",
  "opportunity": "[What's possible if we do act]", 
  "timing": "[Why this moment matters]"
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Hasan consistently emphasizes showing what's at stake. The improved version makes stakes activation a core requirement, not an optional element.

---

### 6. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES AND GUIDANCE

#### ❌ CURRENT (Abstract Guidance)
```
## QUALITY CRITERIA
- Each frame must be genuinely distinct — not three ways of saying the same thing
- Summary must be tweetable (under 280 characters)
- DetailedContent must include at least one "because" clause explaining causation
```

#### ✅ IMPROVED (Concrete Examples)
```
## TRIADIC FRAME EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Healthcare Debate (Pro-Universal Healthcare)
**Audience**: General Public
**Triadic Structure**: Personal/Community/Future
**Emotional Core**: Fear of medical bankruptcy, hope for security

**Frame**: 
- **Personal**: "Every family is one diagnosis away from financial ruin"
- **Community**: "When neighbors can't afford care, we all pay through emergency room costs"  
- **Future**: "Our children deserve the security every other developed nation provides"

**Built-in Preemption**: "Yes, this requires investment, but we're already paying more per capita than any nation on earth — we're just getting worse outcomes."
```

**Why This Matters**: Concrete examples show HOW to apply the methodology, not just WHAT to do. This bridges the gap between theory and practice.

1. **Flexible Triadic Structures**: Eliminates forced categorization that feels unnatural
2. **Emotion-First Process**: Aligns with Hasan's core "pathos over logos" principle
3. **Built-In Preemption**: Makes judo moves feel organic rather than tactical

### Medium Impact Changes (Significant Enhancement)
1. **Audience-Specific Generation**: Creates more targeted, effective frames
2. **Stakes Activation**: Adds urgency and relevance to every argument
3. **Concrete Examples**: Bridges theory-practice gap for better implementation

### Implementation Recommendation

**Phase 1**: Implement flexible triadic structures and emotion-first process
**Phase 2**: Add built-in preemption and audience-specific generation  
**Phase 3**: Enhance with stakes activation and concrete examples

This staged approach allows testing of core improvements while building toward full methodology alignment.
