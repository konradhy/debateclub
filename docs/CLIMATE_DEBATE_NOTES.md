# Climate Change Debate - Quick Reference

**Topic:** Climate change requires immediate action  
**Your Position:** PRO (immediate action is necessary)  
**AI Position:** CON (gradual transition is better)

---

## 🎯 Your Core Arguments

### 1. **The Cost of Inaction Exceeds Cost of Action**
- **Receipt:** IPCC 2023 report: Every year of delay increases costs by 2-3%
- **Receipt:** 2022: $165B in US climate disasters (NOAA)
- **Zinger:** "We can't afford gradual action when the planet is on fire."

### 2. **Tipping Points Are Approaching**
- **Receipt:** Arctic ice melting 13% per decade (NASA)
- **Receipt:** 1.5°C threshold could be breached by 2030 (UN)
- **Zinger:** "Gradual transition? The climate doesn't negotiate."

### 3. **Technology Already Exists**
- **Receipt:** Solar costs down 90% since 2010 (IEA)
- **Receipt:** Renewable energy now cheaper than fossil fuels in most places
- **Zinger:** "We're not waiting for innovation - we're waiting for political will."

### 4. **Economic Opportunity**
- **Receipt:** Clean energy jobs: 3x faster growth than overall economy
- **Receipt:** $4.5T investment opportunity by 2030 (McKinsey)
- **Zinger:** "The green economy isn't coming - it's here."

## 🥋 Techniques to Practice

### **Concession & Pivot** (Defensive)
**Formula:** "You're right that [X], but here's what you're missing: [Y]"

**Examples:**
- "You're absolutely right that transition costs money. But here's what you're missing: we're already paying $165 billion annually in climate disasters."
- "I agree that economic disruption is a concern. But the real question is: disruption now, or collapse later?"

**When to use:** When AI says "costs too much" or "economic disruption"

---

### **Receipts** (Evidence Deployment)
**Deploy specific data when making points**

**Key Receipts:**
- **IPCC 2023:** "Delaying action increases costs 2-3% per year"
- **NOAA 2022:** "$165 billion in climate disasters"
- **NASA:** "Arctic ice melting 13% per decade"
- **IEA:** "Solar costs down 90% since 2010"
- **McKinsey:** "$4.5T green investment opportunity"

**Example:** "According to the IPCC's 2023 report, every year we delay increases costs by 2-3%. That's not gradual - that's expensive."

---

### **Zinger** (Memorable One-Liner)
**Keep it under 20 words, punchy, memorable**

**Examples:**
- "The climate doesn't negotiate."
- "We can't afford gradual when the planet is on fire."
- "The green economy isn't coming - it's here."
- "Disruption now, or collapse later?"
- "We're not waiting for innovation - we're waiting for political will."

**When to use:** After making a strong point, or to close an argument

## 🛡️ Anticipated AI Arguments & Your Responses

### AI: "Economic disruption from rapid change"
**Your Response (Concession & Pivot):**
"You're right that transition requires investment. But here's what you're missing: we're already spending $165 billion annually on climate disasters. The question isn't whether we pay - it's whether we pay proactively or reactively."

---

### AI: "Need technological innovation timeline"
**Your Response (Receipts + Zinger):**
"According to the IEA, solar costs have dropped 90% since 2010. Renewable energy is already cheaper than fossil fuels. We're not waiting for innovation - we're waiting for political will."

---

### AI: "Global coordination challenges"
**Your Response (Reframe):**
"The real question isn't whether global coordination is hard - it's whether we lead or follow. When the US acts, others follow. We saw this with the Paris Agreement."

---

### AI: "Impact on developing nations"
**Your Response (Concession & Pivot):**
"You're absolutely right that developing nations need support. But here's what you're missing: they're already suffering the most from climate change. Immediate action includes massive investment in their green transition."

## 📋 Quick Reference Card

**Opening Statement Template:**
"Climate change isn't a future problem - it's happening now. Every year of delay costs us more. The technology exists, the economics work, and the science is clear. Immediate action isn't radical - it's necessary."

**Closing Statement Template:**
"The question isn't whether we act - it's when. We can pay proactively through investment, or reactively through disasters. The choice is disruption now, or collapse later. Immediate action is the only responsible path."

## 🎯 Debate Flow Strategy

1. **Opening:** Lead with urgency + receipts
2. **Middle:** Use Concession & Pivot when AI makes valid points
3. **Throughout:** Deploy Receipts strategically (don't dump all at once)
4. **Key moments:** Drop Zingers after strong points
5. **Closing:** End with memorable Zinger

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Don't dump all receipts at once** - Space them out
- **Use Concession & Pivot** when AI makes a fair point (builds credibility)
- **Save your best Zinger** for the closing
- **Keep responses under 30 seconds** - Be concise
- **Interrupt if AI rambles** - You can interrupt naturally

---

**Remember:** The system will detect your techniques in real-time. Try to use all three:
- ✅ Concession & Pivot (when AI makes valid points)
- ✅ Receipts (deploy evidence strategically)
- ✅ Zinger (memorable closing lines)

Good luck! 🎤
