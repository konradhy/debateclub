# Scenario System Implementation Plan
**OratorPrep Multi-Scenario Architecture**

---

## COMMANDER'S INTENT

**Mission:** Build a plugin architecture that lets us rapidly create new practice scenarios by writing one config file.

**End State:**
- Create new scenario = write 1 config file (~100 lines)
- All scenarios use the same generic database fields
- Zero code duplication, clean separation
- User selects scenario type (Debate, Sales, Healthcare, etc.)     
- Each scenario has appropriate AI behavior, input forms and labels, prep type, prep materials, and analysis  

For
**Core Principle:**
The codebase doesn't know about "sales" or "debate" - it just knows how to:
1. Read a scenario config
2. Show the right input form
3. Pass the right prompt to Vapi
4. Display prep materials
5. Analyze with the right framework

Everything scenario-specific lives in ONE config file.

---

## THE BIG PICTURE

### Current State (Debate Only)
```
User creates opponent → Research generates prep materials →
Practice debate with Mehdi Hasan AI → Get Hasan-specific analysis
```

### Target State (Multi-Scenario)
```
User selects scenario type → Creates scenario-specific opponent →
Optional prep (scenario-dependent) → Practice with scenario-appropriate AI →
Get scenario-specific analysis
```

---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Scenario Config System (Plugin Architecture)

**One file per category, multiple variations per file:**

```typescript
// scenarios/sales.ts
const baseSalesConfig = {
  category: "sales",
  pipeline: {
    research: false,        // Skip research step
    prep: true,             // Show prep page
    prepType: "generic"     // Use GenericPrepPage component
  },
  inputs: {
    topic: { label: "What are you selling?", placeholder: "...", required: true },
    opponentDescription: { label: "Prospect background", placeholder: "..." },
    talkingPoints: { label: "Common objections", placeholder: "..." },
    // ... shared across all sales scenarios
  },
  analysis: {
    framework: "sales", // Identifies which analysis framework this uses
    scoreCategories: [
      // Sales-specific categories (defined here, displayed by GenericAnalysisView)
      { name: "Discovery", description: "Did they uncover the real objection?" },
      { name: "Control", description: "Did they maintain conversation flow?" },
      { name: "Confidence", description: "Did they handle pushback confidently?" },
      { name: "Closing", description: "Did they advance the deal?" }
    ],
    systemPrompt: `Analyze this sales call focusing on Discovery, Control, Confidence, and Closing...`
  }
}

export const SalesScenarios = {
  'cold-prospect': {
    ...baseSalesConfig,
    id: "sales-cold-prospect",
    name: "Sales - Cold Prospect",
    assistant: {
      firstMessage: [
        "Who is this? How'd you get my number?",
        "I'm in the middle of something. What's this about?",
        "We're not interested in whatever you're selling."
      ], // Randomly picks one
      systemPrompt: `You are a cold prospect who's never heard of the caller...`,
      voice: { provider: "11labs", voiceId: "..." }
    }
  },

  'demo-followup': {
    ...baseSalesConfig,
    id: "sales-demo-followup",
    name: "Sales - Demo Follow-up",
    assistant: {
      firstMessage: [
        "Thanks for the demo yesterday. I have some concerns...",
        "I discussed this with my team. We have questions..."
      ],
      systemPrompt: `You saw a demo. You're interested but have objections...`
    }
  }
}
```

**Scenarios registry:**
```typescript
// scenarios/index.ts
import { DebateScenario } from './debate'
import { SalesScenarios } from './sales'
import { EntrepreneurScenarios } from './entrepreneur'

export const SCENARIOS = {
  'debate': DebateScenario,
  'sales-cold-prospect': SalesScenarios['cold-prospect'],
  'sales-demo-followup': SalesScenarios['demo-followup'],
  'entrepreneur-pitch': EntrepreneurScenarios['pitch'],
  // Add more variations here...
}
```

---

## INITIAL SCENARIOS (Prove the Engine)

### 1. Debate (Refactor Existing)
**File:** `scenarios/debate.ts`
- Single scenario (no variations)
- AI: Skilled debater using debate techniques
- Prep: DebatePrepPage (openings, arguments, zingers, receipts, closings)
- Quick Ref: Opening, Closing, Arguments, Zingers, Counters, Receipts
- Analysis: Debate-specific scorecard

### 2. Sales (First New Category)
**File:** `scenarios/sales.ts` with 2 variations
- **Cold Prospect** - Never heard of you, skeptical from the start
- **Demo Follow-up** - Saw demo, interested but has objections

**Shared config:**
- Prep: GenericPrepPage (talking points, response map, key phrases)
- Quick Ref: Opening Approach, Talking Points, Response Map, Key Phrases, Things to Avoid, Closing
- Analysis: Sales framework with 4 scoreCategories
  - Discovery: Did they uncover the real objection?
  - Control: Did they maintain conversation flow?
  - Confidence: Did they handle pushback confidently?
  - Closing: Did they advance the deal?

**Different per variation:**
- First message array (randomly selected)
- System prompt (cold vs warm behavior)

### 3. Entrepreneur (Second New Category)
**File:** `scenarios/entrepreneur.ts`
- **Investor Pitch** - Pitching to skeptical investor

**Config:**
- Prep: GenericPrepPage
- Quick Ref: Opening Approach, Talking Points, Response Map, Key Phrases, Things to Avoid, Closing
- Analysis: Pitch framework with 4 scoreCategories
  - Clarity: Was the pitch clear and concise?
  - Confidence: Did they handle tough questions confidently?
  - Handling Skepticism: How did they respond to pushback?
  - Business Acumen: Do they understand their metrics/market?

**Launch with:** Debate + 2 Sales variations + 1 Entrepreneur = 4 total scenarios

**Note:** Once validated, add more variations to sales.ts or entrepreneur.ts, or create new category files.

## VAPI CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Based on [Vapi API documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create), here are the available configuration options we can control per scenario:

### Core Settings
- `name`: Assistant identifier
- `firstMessage`: Initial greeting/opening
- `model`: LLM configuration (provider, model, temperature, etc.)
- `voice`: Voice provider and settings (11labs, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, etc.)
- `transcriber`: Speech-to-text configuration (Deepgram, Assembly AI, OpenAI, etc.)

### Behavioral Controls
- `model.messages`: System prompt array with role and content
- `model.temperature`: Creativity/randomness (0-1)
- `model.maxTokens`: Response length limit
- `silenceTimeoutSeconds`: How long to wait for user speech
- `responseDelaySeconds`: Delay before assistant starts speaking
- `llmRequestDelaySeconds`: Delay before sending to LLM

### Advanced Features (Available in 2025)
- `backgroundSound`: Background audio during calls
- `voicemailDetection`: Configure or disable voicemail detection
- `keypadInputPlan`: Handle DTMF keypad inputs (for phone calls)
- `compliancePlan`: HIPAA/PCI compliance settings
- `realtimeConfig`: Real-time model configuration (Gemini 2.0)

### What We'll Use Per Scenario
Different scenarios will vary primarily in:
1. **System prompt** (`model.messages`)
2. **First message** (`firstMessage`) - Can be string or array for random variety
3. **Voice settings** (potentially different voices for different scenarios)
4. **Temperature** (debates might be more dynamic, pitches more measured)

### Random First Messages Feature
To keep practice sessions fresh, scenarios can define multiple first messages:

```typescript
// Config
assistant: {
  firstMessage: [
    "Who is this? How'd you get my number?",
    "I'm busy. What's this about?",
    "Not interested."
  ]
}

// Implementation in debate.tsx
const firstMessage = Array.isArray(scenario.assistant.firstMessage)
  ? scenario.assistant.firstMessage[Math.floor(Math.random() * scenario.assistant.firstMessage.length)]
  : scenario.assistant.firstMessage
```

Each practice session randomly selects one message, creating variety.

---

## DETAILED CHANGES REQUIRED

### 1. SCHEMA CHANGES

**File:** `convex/schema.ts`

**CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE:** All scenarios use the SAME generic database fields. We are NOT creating scenario-specific schemas. The same `talkingPoints`, `openingApproach`, etc. work for Debate, Sales, and Entrepreneur Pitch - they just mean different things in context.

**opponents table - ADD:**
```typescript
scenarioType: v.string(), // "debate", "sales-cold-prospect", "sales-demo-followup", "entrepreneur-pitch"
prepType: v.string(), // "debate" or "generic" - controls which prep page component to show

// Generic prep fields (used by all non-debate scenarios)
talkingPoints: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
openingApproach: v.optional(v.string()),
keyPhrases: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
thingsToAvoid: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
responseMap: v.optional(v.array(v.object({
  trigger: v.string(),
  response: v.string()
}))),
closingApproach: v.optional(v.string()),

// Keep debate-specific fields (only populated for debate scenarios)
openingOptions: v.optional(...),
argumentFrames: v.optional(...),
zingers: v.optional(...),
receipts: v.optional(...),
opponentIntel: v.optional(...),
closingOptions: v.optional(...),
```

**analyses table - MODIFY:**
```typescript
analysisFramework: v.string(), // "debate", "sales", "entrepreneur", etc.

// Debate-specific fields (only populated for debate scenarios)
techniqueScorecard: v.optional(...),
hasanScores: v.optional(...),

// Generic analysis fields (used by sales, entrepreneur, legal, etc.)
// Each scenario defines its own scoreCategories in config, stored here
skillsAssessment: v.optional(v.array(v.object({
  name: v.string(),        // e.g., "Discovery" (sales) or "Clarity" (entrepreneur)
  score: v.number(),       // 1-10
  feedback: v.string()     // Specific feedback for this skill
}))),
```

**How Analysis Works:**
- **DebateAnalysisView:** Shows Hasan-specific scorecard (techniqueScorecard, hasanScores)
- **GenericAnalysisView:** Shows skillsAssessment array (works for ANY scenario's categories)
- Each scenario config defines its own scoreCategories (Sales has 4, Entrepreneur might have 5, Legal might have 6)
- GenericAnalysisView is a flexible template that displays whatever categories the scenario defines

---

### 2. INPUT FORM CHANGES

**File:** `src/routes/_app/_auth/dashboard/opponents.tsx` (opponent creation)

**Changes:**
1. Add scenario type selector at top of form
2. Show/hide fields based on selected scenario
3. Change field labels/placeholders per scenario

**Example:**
```typescript
const scenario = SCENARIOS[selectedScenarioType]

// Topic field
<Input
  label={scenario.inputs.topic.label}
  placeholder={scenario.inputs.topic.placeholder}
  // ...
/>

// Position field (hide for non-debate)
{!scenario.inputs.position.hidden && (
  <Select label="Position">...</Select>
)}
```

**Field Mapping by Scenario:**

| Field | Debate | Sales | Entrepreneur Pitch |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| topic | "Debate Topic" | "What are you selling?" | "What's your business/product?" |
| position | "pro/con" | HIDDEN | HIDDEN |
| talkingPoints | "Arguments" | "Common Objections" | "Anticipated Questions" |
| opponentDescription | "Opponent Bio" | "Prospect Background" | "Investor Background" |

---

### 3. PIPELINE CHANGES

**What runs when user creates opponent:**

**Debate Scenario:**
```
Create opponent → Run research → Generate debate prep → Ready to practice
```

**Non-Debate Scenarios:**
```
Create opponent → [SKIP research] → Generate generic prep → Ready to practice
```

**Files to modify:**
- `convex/actions/prep.ts` - Add scenario check, skip research if `pipeline.research = false`
- `convex/actions/geminiPrep.ts` - Same
- Create `convex/actions/genericPrep.ts` - Generate generic prep materials

---

### 4. PREP PAGE CHANGES

**File:** `src/routes/_app/_auth/dashboard/prep.tsx`

**Current:** Shows debate-specific tabs (Study Mode with openings, arguments, zingers, receipts, closings, intel, etc.)

**New: Route to different components based on prepType:**
```typescript
function PrepScreen() {
  const { opponent } = ...

  // Route based on prepType from scenario config
  if (opponent.prepType === 'debate') {
    return <DebatePrepPage opponent={opponent} />
  } else {
    return <GenericPrepPage opponent={opponent} />
  }
}
```

**DebatePrepPage (debate-only, refactored from current):**
- Study Mode tab: Openings, Arguments, Zingers, Receipts, Closings, Opponent Intel
- Quick Reference tab: Opening, Closing, Arguments, Zingers, Counters, Receipts
- Research tab
- Chat tab

**GenericPrepPage (shared template for sales, entrepreneur, legal, healthcare, future scenarios):**
- Study Mode tab:
  - Talking Points (editable list)
  - Opening Approach (text field)
  - Key Phrases (editable list)
  - Things to Avoid (editable list)
  - Response Map (trigger → response pairs)
  - Closing Approach (text field)
- Quick Reference tab: Opening Approach, Talking Points, Response Map, Key Phrases, Things to Avoid, Closing
- Chat tab (optional)

**Quick Reference Tab:**
Both have this tab (existing feature), different content per type:
- **DebatePrepPage Quick Ref:** Shows selected openings, arguments, zingers, counters, receipts, closings
- **GenericPrepPage Quick Ref:** Shows talking points, opening approach, response map, key phrases, things to avoid, closing

---

### 5. VAPI/ASSISTANT CHANGES

**File:** `src/routes/_app/_auth/dashboard/debate.tsx`

**Current:** Hardcoded debate system prompt (lines 244-270)

**New:**
```typescript
const scenario = SCENARIOS[opponent.scenarioType]

// Handle random first message selection
const firstMessage = Array.isArray(scenario.assistant.firstMessage)
  ? scenario.assistant.firstMessage[Math.floor(Math.random() * scenario.assistant.firstMessage.length)]
  : scenario.assistant.firstMessage

const assistantConfig = {
  model: { ... },
  transcriber: { ... },
  voice: scenario.assistant.voice,

  firstMessage: firstMessage,

  systemPrompt: scenario.assistant.systemPrompt
    .replace('{{TOPIC}}', opponent.topic)
    .replace('{{OPPONENT_DESC}}', opponent.opponentDescription)
    // ... other replacements
}
```

**System Prompt Examples:**

**Debate (current):**
```
You are a skilled debater using Mehdi Hasan's debate techniques...
```

**Sales - Cold Prospect:**
```typescript
// Config
assistant: {
  firstMessage: [
    "Who is this? How'd you get my number?",
    "I'm in the middle of something. What's this about?",
    "We're not interested in whatever you're selling.",
    "Can you send me some info? I don't have time.",
    "I'm happy with our current solution."
  ],
  systemPrompt: `
You are a cold prospect who's never heard of the caller or their company.

BEHAVIOR:
- Start skeptical/annoyed (cold call)
- Ask "Who is this?" or "How'd you get my number?"
- Use brush-offs: "I'm busy", "Not interested", "Send me info"
- If they persist, raise objections: price, timing, need, competitor
- Push back on weak responses: "That doesn't answer my question"
- Don't be hostile, just busy and skeptical
- Gradually warm up ONLY if they handle it really well

BACKGROUND:
{{OPPONENT_DESC}}

PRODUCT/SERVICE:
{{TOPIC}}

YOUR GOAL: Be a realistic cold prospect - skeptical, short on time, needs convincing.
  `
}
```

**Sales - Demo Follow-up:**
```typescript
// Config
assistant: {
  firstMessage: [
    "Thanks for the demo yesterday. I have some concerns...",
    "I discussed this with my team. We have questions.",
    "The demo was good, but I'm not sure about the price."
  ],
  systemPrompt: `
You saw a product demo recently. You're interested but have real objections.

BEHAVIOR:
- Reference the demo you saw
- You're more engaged than a cold prospect (you took a meeting)
- Raise specific concerns: price, implementation time, features, integration
- Compare to competitors you're evaluating
- Ask about ROI, support, training
- You're genuinely considering but need convincing

BACKGROUND:
{{OPPONENT_DESC}}

PRODUCT/SERVICE:
{{TOPIC}}

YOUR GOAL: Be a warm prospect with legitimate concerns that need addressing.
  `
}
```

**Entrepreneur Pitch:**
```typescript
// Config
assistant: {
  firstMessage: [
    "Walk me through your business. What problem are you solving?",
    "I've seen a lot of pitches in this space. What makes you different?",
    "Interesting. Tell me about your traction so far.",
    "How big is this market, really?"
  ],
  systemPrompt: `
You are a skeptical investor evaluating a startup pitch.

BEHAVIOR:
- Ask tough questions: business model, traction, competition, unit economics
- Push on weak points: "How is this defensible?", "What's your CAC?"
- Question assumptions: "Why would customers switch?"
- Be professional but challenging
- If they answer well, dig deeper - test if they really know their business
- If they dodge or BS, call it out politely: "That's not what I asked"
- Look for red flags: vague answers, no metrics, ignoring competition

BACKGROUND:
{{OPPONENT_DESC}}

BUSINESS PITCH:
{{TOPIC}}

YOUR GOAL: Be a realistic investor - experienced, pattern-matching, looking for red flags but open to being convinced.
  `
}
```

**Interruption Settings per Scenario:**
```typescript
// Debate: AI can interrupt aggressively
canInterrupt: true,
interruptionThreshold: 100

// Sales: AI doesn't interrupt (realistic prospect behavior)
canInterrupt: false

// Entrepreneur Pitch: AI can interrupt with questions
canInterrupt: true,
interruptionThreshold: 150
```

---

### 6. CHEAT SHEET IN DEBATE SCREEN

**File:** `src/routes/_app/_auth/dashboard/debate.tsx`

**Add collapsible sidebar during call:**

```tsx
<div className="flex h-full">
  {/* Cheat Sheet Sidebar */}
  <div className="w-80 border-r bg-secondary/30 p-4 overflow-y-auto">
    <h3 className="font-semibold mb-4">Your Cheat Sheet</h3>

    {/* Talking Points */}
    <section className="mb-6">
      <h4 className="text-sm font-bold mb-2">📌 Talking Points</h4>
      <ul className="text-sm space-y-1">
        {opponent.talkingPoints?.map(point => (
          <li key={point}>• {point}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>

    {/* Response Map */}
    <section className="mb-6">
      <h4 className="text-sm font-bold mb-2">🎯 If They Say...</h4>
      {opponent.responseMap?.map(item => (
        <div key={item.trigger} className="text-xs mb-2 p-2 bg-background rounded">
          <div className="font-medium">"{item.trigger}"</div>
          <div className="text-muted-foreground">→ {item.response}</div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </section>

    {/* Things to Avoid */}
    <section>
      <h4 className="text-sm font-bold mb-2">⚠️ Avoid</h4>
      <ul className="text-xs space-y-1">
        {opponent.thingsToAvoid?.map(item => (
          <li key={item} className="text-red-600">• {item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>
  </div>

  {/* Main Call Area */}
  <div className="flex-1">
    {/* Existing debate UI */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Make it collapsible:**
- Toggle button to hide/show
- Persists state in localStorage
- Mobile: overlay instead of sidebar

---

### 7. ANALYSIS CHANGES

**File:** `convex/actions/analysis.ts`

**Current:** Hardcoded Hasan technique analysis

**New:**
```typescript
const scenario = SCENARIOS[opponent.scenarioType]

const analysisPrompt = scenario.analysis.systemPrompt
  .replace('{{TRANSCRIPT}}', transcript)
  .replace('{{TALKING_POINTS}}', opponent.talkingPoints.join('\n'))

const analysis = await analyzeWithOpenAI(analysisPrompt)
```

**Analysis Prompt Examples:**

**Debate:**
```
Analyze this debate using Mehdi Hasan's framework...
Score: Zingers, Receipts, Judo Moves, etc.
```

**Sales:**
```
Analyze this sales call focusing on:

DISCOVERY: Did they uncover the real objection behind "too expensive"?
- Did they ask "Compared to what?" or similar probing questions?
- Did they listen or just pitch features?

CONTROL: Did they maintain control without being pushy?
- Did they let the prospect brush them off?
- Did they advance the conversation or let it stall?

CONFIDENCE: Were they confident or did they fumble?
- Did they hesitate when defending price?
- Did they offer discounts too early?

CLOSING: Did they advance the deal?
- Did they book next steps?
- Or did they end with "I'll send you some info"?

Provide specific moments where they excelled or struggled.
```

**Output Schema per Scenario:**

**Debate:**
```typescript
{
  analysisFramework: "debate",
  techniqueScorecard: { ... Hasan techniques },
  hasanScores: { ... }
}
```

**Sales:**
```typescript
{
  analysisFramework: "sales",
  skillsAssessment: [
    { name: "Discovery", score: 7, feedback: "Good probing questions..." },
    { name: "Control", score: 5, feedback: "Let prospect brush you off..." },
    { name: "Confidence", score: 8, feedback: "Didn't panic on price..." },
    { name: "Closing", score: 6, feedback: "Got next meeting but could be stronger..." }
  ]
}
```

---

### 8. ANALYSIS DISPLAY CHANGES

**File:** `src/routes/_app/_auth/dashboard/analysis.tsx`

**Current:** Shows Hasan-specific scorecard

**New:**
```typescript
if (analysis.analysisFramework === 'debate') {
  return <DebateAnalysisView analysis={analysis} />
} else {
  return <GenericAnalysisView analysis={analysis} />
}
```

**GenericAnalysisView shows:**
- Skills Assessment (radar chart or bars)
- Moment-by-moment breakdown
- Missed opportunities
- Practice recommendations

---

## UNIVERSAL VS SCENARIO-SPECIFIC

### Universal (All Scenarios)
✅ **From Mehdi Hasan Book:**
- Know Your Audience
- Emotional Connection
- Listening (Critical + Empathetic)
- Confidence Under Pressure
- Composure (Stay Calm)
- Practice/Preparation
- Judo Moves (Concession, Preemption, Reframing)

✅ **Analysis Categories:**
- Preparation Quality
- Emotional Intelligence
- Listening & Responding
- Composure Under Pressure
- Specificity vs Vagueness
- Practice Recommendations

### Debate-Specific Only
❌ Zingers
❌ Booby Traps
❌ Gish Gallop Defense
❌ Receipts/Evidence Arsenal
❌ Peroration/Grand Finale
❌ Rule of Three (useful but not critical)

### Scenario-Specific Additions

**Sales:**
- Discovery (uncovering real objections)
- Control (maintaining conversation flow)
- Closing (advancing the deal)

**Healthcare:**
- Presence (sitting with silence)
- Empathy (naming emotions)
- Patient-Centeredness

**Manager:**
- Clarity (being specific, not vague)
- Handling Defensiveness
- Actionable Next Steps

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Technical:**
- ✅ Adding new scenario requires only 1 config file
- ✅ No duplicate code between scenarios
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

**User:**
- ✅ Sales scenario feels realistic (not like a debate)
- ✅ Prep materials are relevant per scenario
- ✅ Analysis provides scenario-specific insights

**Business:**
- ✅ Can market to 6 different audiences
- ✅ Each use case has dedicated landing page
- ✅ Conversion improves from better product-market fit

---

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Complexity Explosion
**Problem:** Adding 6 scenarios = 6x complexity
**Mitigation:** Plugin architecture keeps each scenario isolated

### Risk 2: Schema Bloat
**Problem:** Adding fields for every scenario clutters schema
**Mitigation:** Generic fields work for most scenarios, debate-specific fields are optional

### Risk 3: AI Prompts Don't Work
**Problem:** Sales AI doesn't behave realistically
**Mitigation:** Iterate on prompts, test with real users, use voice settings to enhance realism

### Risk 4: Analysis Quality Drops
**Problem:** Generic analysis not as insightful as Hasan-specific
**Mitigation:** Scenario-specific analysis prompts, focus on actionable feedback

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Should we generate generic prep with AI or leave it blank for user to fill?**
   - Option A: AI suggests based on scenario
   - Option B: User fills it manually
   - Recommendation: AI suggests, user edits

2. **Do we need scenario-specific analysis views or is generic enough?**
   - Start with generic, add specific views if needed

3. **Should cheat sheet be visible during debate or only after?**
   - During (like having notes during a call)
   - Can toggle if user wants "hard mode"

4. **How do we handle existing opponents when we add scenarioType?**
   - Migration: Set all existing to scenarioType: "debate"

## FINAL SUMMARY

**Mission:** Build a plugin architecture for rapid scenario creation.

**Core Principle:** The codebase doesn't know about specific scenarios - it reads config files. Each scenario is ONE file that controls everything.

**What Changes:**
- Opponent schema adds `scenarioType` + generic prep fields
- Input forms show/hide fields based on scenario config
- Prep page routes to DebatePrepPage OR GenericPrepPage
- Vapi gets system prompts from scenario config
- Analysis uses scenario-specific frameworks
- Debate screen shows cheat sheet with prep materials during practice

**What Stays the Same:**
- Core Vapi integration
- Database structure (generic fields work for all scenarios)
- User flow (create → prep → practice → analyze)
- All UI components (reused across scenarios)

**Launch Scenarios (4 total):**
1. **Debate** - Refactor existing into debate.ts config
2. **Sales - Cold Prospect** - Skeptical prospect who's never heard of you
3. **Sales - Demo Follow-up** - Warm prospect who saw demo, has objections
4. **Entrepreneur - Investor Pitch** - Pitching to skeptical investor

**Key Features:**
- **Random first messages:** Each scenario has array of opening messages, randomly selected per session
- **Shared configs:** Sales variations share inputs/analysis, only prompts differ
- **Different prep pages:** Debate uses DebatePrepPage, others use GenericPrepPage
- **Quick Reference:** Both prep types have Quick Ref tab with scenario-appropriate categories

**End Result:**
User picks "Sales - Cold Prospect" → Gets sales-specific form → AI randomly opens with one of 5 greetings → Practice with realistic cold prospect → Quick ref shows talking points during call → Get sales-specific feedback.

**Scaling:**
- Add sales variation = add entry to SalesScenarios object in sales.ts
- Add new category = create new file (e.g., legal.ts)
- One file per category, N variations per file
