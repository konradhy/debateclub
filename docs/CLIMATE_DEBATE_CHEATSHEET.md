## 🎯 3 Core Arguments

1. **Cost of delay:** IPCC says 2-3% cost increase per year of delay
2. **Tipping points:** Arctic melting 13%/decade, 1.5°C by 2030
3. **Tech exists:** Solar down 90% since 2010, renewables cheaper now

## 📊 Key Receipts (Use Strategically)

- **IPCC 2023:** Delay = +2-3% cost per year
- **NOAA 2022:** $165B in US climate disasters
- **NASA:** Arctic ice -13% per decade
- **IEA:** Solar costs -90% since 2010
- **McKinsey:** $4.5T green investment opportunity

## 🥋 Technique Examples

### Concession & Pivot
"You're right that [costs money], but here's what you're missing: [we're already paying $165B/year]"

### Receipts
"According to the IPCC's 2023 report, every year of delay increases costs by 2-3%."

### Zingers (under 20 words)
- "The climate doesn't negotiate."
- "Disruption now, or collapse later?"
- "We're not waiting for innovation - we're waiting for political will."

## 🛡️ AI Arguments → Your Responses

**AI: "Economic disruption"**
→ "You're right about costs. But we're already paying $165B/year in disasters."

**AI: "Need innovation timeline"**
→ "Solar costs dropped 90% since 2010. Tech exists - we need political will."

**AI: "Global coordination hard"**
→ "The question isn't whether it's hard - it's whether we lead or follow."

## 💬 Opening
"Climate change is happening now. Every year of delay costs more. Tech exists, economics work, science is clear. Immediate action isn't radical - it's necessary."

## 💬 Closing
"The choice: disruption now, or collapse later. Immediate action is the only responsible path."
