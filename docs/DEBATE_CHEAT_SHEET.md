# Debate Cheat Sheet & Notes

## Core Mehdi Hasan Techniques

### 1. Concession & Pivot
**Concept:** Disarm your opponent by agreeing with a small, undeniable part of their argument, then immediately shift the ground to your stronger point.
**Formula:** "You're right about [X]. But the real issue is [Y]."
**Example:** "You're right that the economy is growing. But the real issue is that wage growth has stagnated for the working class."

### 2. Receipts (Evidence)
**Concept:** Don't just assert; prove. Have specific data, quotes, or dates ready to deploy.
**Strategy:** Wait for them to make a specific claim, then drop the receipt to contradict it.
**Example:** "You say you never supported that bill? Here is the vote record from 2018 where you voted 'Yea'."

### 3. The Zinger
**Concept:** A short, memorable, witty line that crystallizes your argument and plays well to the audience.
**Rules:** Keep it under 20 words. Make it punchy.
**Example:** "You're not entitled to your own facts, just your own opinions."

### 4. Reframing (The Premise Check)
**Concept:** Reject the premise of a loaded question or argument. Don't answer a question that assumes you are wrong.
**Formula:** "I don't accept the premise of your question because..."
**Example:** "I'm not going to answer which of these bad options I prefer, because we shouldn't be in this situation in the first place."

### 5. Preemption
**Concept:** Anticipate their best argument and address it before they can even make it. Steal their thunder.
**Formula:** "Now, my opponent is going to tell you [X], but here is why that doesn't hold water..."

### 6. Provocative Question
**Concept:** Ask a question that forces your opponent into a defensive position or exposes a contradiction.
**Formula:** "If you believe [X], then why did you support [Y]?"

### 7. Personal Story
**Concept:** Humanize abstract arguments with a relatable anecdote. Connect emotionally with the audience.
**Formula:** "I met a woman in Ohio who told me..."

### 8. Rule of Three
**Concept:** Structure your arguments in groups of three. It makes them memorable and authoritative.
**Formula:** "This policy is unfair, unworkable, and unnecessary."

### 9. Peroration
**Concept:** End with a high-energy, emotional summary. Leave the audience inspired or outraged.
**Formula:** "We cannot wait. We cannot hesitate. We must act now."

### 10. Gish Gallop Attack (Defense)
**Concept:** When an opponent overwhelms you with a flood of weak arguments, don't refute them all. Pick the weakest one, destroy it, and dismiss the rest.
**Formula:** "He just listed 10 things, but let's look at the first one..."

### 11. Strategic Interruption
**Concept:** Break their rhythm when they are rambling or misleading. Do it sparingly and politely but firmly.
**Formula:** "Forgive me, but that is simply not true."
