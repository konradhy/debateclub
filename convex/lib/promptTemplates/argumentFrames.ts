=== YOUR TASK ===
Generate 6-10 distinct argument frames for this debate.

## USING THE STRATEGIC BRIEF
- If audience context was provided, prioritize frames that will resonate with THAT specific audience's values and concerns
- If opponent intel was provided, include frames that counter their likely arguments or exploit their weaknesses
- If the user emphasized specific points, ensure those are incorporated into relevant frames
- Consider the debate format when structuring complexity

## USING THE RESEARCH SOURCES
- **Research Synthesis**: Use for strategic insights, major perspectives, and points of consensus/contention
- **Raw Research Sources**: Use for specific article titles, source credibility, and identifying which publications support which viewpoints
- Build frames that can reference specific studies or publications by name for credibility

## CORE PRINCIPLES (Hasan's Methodology)

### 1. **EMOTION DRIVES EVERYTHING** (Chapter 2: "Pathos Over Logos")
**Hasan Quote**: "Pathos beats logos almost every time."
- Start with emotional stakes: What should the audience FEEL about this issue?
- Connect logical arguments to visceral human concerns
- Ask: "Why should someone care deeply about this?"

### 2. **FLEXIBLE TRIADIC STRUCTURES** (Chapter 7: "Rule of Three")  
**Hasan Quote**: "Making a Political, an Economic, and a Moral argument for or against something."
- Use triads, but adapt structure to audience and context
- The categories below are guidelines, not rigid requirements
- Choose frameworks that feel natural and compelling for THIS debate

### 3. **AUDIENCE-FIRST FRAMING** (Chapter 1: "Know Your Audience")
**Hasan Quote**: "Present arguments in a way that aligns with the audience's interests or identities."
- If audience context provided: tailor language and values to THAT specific group
- If no audience context: generate frames for different audience types (business, general public, experts)
- Consider what each audience cares about most

### 4. **BUILT-IN DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY** (Chapter 8: "Judo Moves")
**Hasan Quote**: "Acknowledging the areas where the opponent has valid points opens the door to highlight where they fall short."
- Build preemption and concession pivots into frame structure from the start
- Don't just describe arguments — show how to deploy them effectively
- Integrate judo moves naturally, not as add-on techniques

### 5. **STAKES ACTIVATION** (Throughout Hasan's work)
- Every frame must answer: "What's at risk?" and "What's possible?"
- Show consequences of inaction and benefits of action
- Create urgency through timing and opportunity

## FRAME GENERATION APPROACH

**STEP 1: Emotional Foundation First**
Before building logical structure, identify:
- What emotions should this frame activate? (Fear, hope, outrage, pride, urgency)
- What are the stakes? (What happens if we do nothing vs. what becomes possible if we act)
- How does this connect to human concerns the audience cares about?

**STEP 2: Flexible Category Adaptation**
Use the categories below as starting points, but adapt based on:
- What the research reveals as the strongest angles
- What the strategic brief suggests about audience and opponent
- What emotional foundation works best for this specific debate

**STEP 3: Deployment Integration**
Build each frame with deployment strategy from the start:
- How to introduce this frame (concession, preemption, reframing)
- When to reveal supporting evidence for maximum impact
- How to challenge opponent to match your evidence

## FRAME CATEGORIES (Flexible Guidelines)

**Use these as starting points, not rigid requirements. Adapt based on what works best for this specific debate:**

### **Moral/Ethical Frames** (2-3 arguments)
**Emotional Foundation**: What's right vs. wrong, fair vs. unfair, just vs. unjust
- Rights-based arguments (individual rights, civil liberties, human dignity)
- Justice-based arguments (fairness, equality, protecting the vulnerable)
- Values-based arguments (tradition, progress, freedom, responsibility)
- **Audience Adaptation**: 
  - General Public: Focus on fairness and protecting families
  - Religious Audiences: Connect to moral teachings and values
  - Progressive Audiences: Emphasize justice and equality

### **Practical/Consequentialist Frames** (2-3 arguments)
**Emotional Foundation**: What works vs. what fails, safety vs. danger, progress vs. stagnation
- Effectiveness arguments (what works, proven outcomes, evidence-based solutions)
- Safety/security arguments (protecting people, preventing harm, ensuring stability)
- Quality of life arguments (making life better, solving real problems)
- **Audience Adaptation**:
  - Business Audiences: Focus on efficiency and results
  - General Public: Emphasize safety and quality of life
  - Skeptical Audiences: Lead with proven track records

### **Economic Frames** (1-2 arguments)
**Emotional Foundation**: Prosperity vs. waste, opportunity vs. loss, growth vs. decline
- Cost-benefit arguments (smart investment, avoiding waste, long-term savings)
- Market/incentive arguments (economic growth, job creation, competitive advantage)
- Resource allocation arguments (priorities, efficiency, maximizing impact)
- **Audience Adaptation**:
  - Business Leaders: Focus on competitive advantage and ROI
  - General Public: Emphasize job creation and cost savings
  - Fiscal Conservatives: Lead with waste reduction and efficiency

### **Historical/Precedent Frames** (1-2 arguments)
**Emotional Foundation**: Learning from past vs. repeating mistakes, proven success vs. failed experiments
- Lessons from history (what we've learned, mistakes to avoid, patterns that repeat)
- International comparisons (what works elsewhere, learning from others' success/failure)
- Precedent and tradition (building on what works, respecting established principles)
- **Audience Adaptation**:
  - Academic Audiences: Focus on rigorous historical analysis
  - Conservative Audiences: Emphasize tradition and proven approaches
  - Progressive Audiences: Highlight successful reforms and positive change

## DEPLOYMENT TECHNIQUES (from Hasan Chapters 3 & 8)
When deploying argument frames in debate dialogue, use these proven techniques:

**1. CONCESSION PIVOT (Synchoresis)** - Hasan Ch 8: "Judo Moves"
- **What**: Acknowledge a valid aspect of opponent's position, then redirect to your stronger point
- **Why it works**: Hasan: "Acknowledging the areas where the opponent has valid points opens the door to highlight where they fall short. This makes you appear more reasoned and credible. It disarms and disorients opponents who expected resistance."
- **Pattern**: "You're right that [valid point]. But what you're missing is [your counter]."
- **Example**: "You're absolutely right that individual liberty matters. But what you're missing is that true liberty requires everyone to be protected from preventable harm."

**2. REFRAMING** - Hasan Ch 8: "Judo Moves"
- **What**: Shift the context of the debate to favor your perspective by questioning the premise
- **Why it works**: Hasan: "If a motion is unfavorable, attempting to reframe or broaden its scope can shift the debate's direction to your benefit."
- **Pattern**: "The real question isn't [their frame], it's [your frame]."
- **Example**: "The real question isn't whether we can afford universal healthcare—it's whether we can afford to keep letting Americans go bankrupt from medical bills."

**3. PREEMPTION** - Hasan Ch 8: "Judo Moves"
- **What**: Address opponent's arguments before they make them
- **Why it works**: Hasan: "Initiating the discourse allows you to define the debate's terms and unsettle your opponent before they have the chance to speak."
- **Pattern**: "Now, some will argue [their point]. But consider [why it's wrong]."
- **Example**: "Now, some will say this hurts the economy. But when Massachusetts implemented this policy, job growth exceeded the national average by 12%. So when opponents claim economic harm, what's their evidence?"

**4. EVIDENCE INTEGRATION** - Hasan Ch 3: "Show Your Receipts"
- **What**: Deploy specific evidence within your argument, then challenge opponent to match it
- **Why it works**: Hasan: "The aim is to find the opportune moment to reveal this evidence, ideally catching the opponent unprepared."
- **Pattern**: "[Argument]. [Evidence with source]. So when [opponent claims X], what's their evidence?"
- **Example**: "Public safety depends on evidence-based policy. The CDC tracked 657,000 children over 15 years and found zero causal link between vaccines and autism. Zero. So when opponents tell parents not to vaccinate, what's their evidence?"

## EXAMPLE QUOTE REQUIREMENT
Each frame must include an "exampleQuote" showing this argument deployed in actual debate dialogue using one of the techniques above.

**Quality Criteria**:
- 1-2 sentences maximum (spoken debate pacing)
- Must use a specific deployment technique (Concession, Reframe, Preemption, or Evidence Integration)
- Should connect to the emotional core of the argument
- Must feel natural when spoken aloud
- Should show HOW to deploy the frame, not just WHAT the argument is
- Must embody a Hasan principle, not just copy surface patterns

## EVIDENCE SUPPORT FROM RESEARCH
For "evidenceNeeded", extract 2-3 specific findings from the research articles that support THIS frame:
- Cite the source name
- State the specific finding (stat, fact, conclusion, expert opinion)
- Explain how it supports this specific argument frame

Format: "[Source Name]: [Specific finding] - [How it supports this frame]"

Example: "WHO 2024 Water Report: 2.2 billion people lack safe water access - Demonstrates the scale of the crisis for moral imperative argument"
