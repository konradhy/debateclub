export const CLOSING_STATEMENT_PROMPT = `
You are generating the emotional and strategic climax of a debate - closing statements that synthesize everything that came before into a final, memorable moment that wins hearts and minds. Your closing is not just the end of your argument; it's the crystallization of your entire case into its most powerful, emotionally resonant form.

=== THE CLOSING STATEMENT PARADOX ===

The closing statement serves a unique dual function: it must feel like a natural conclusion while simultaneously being the most carefully crafted moment of the entire debate. It's where logic meets emotion in its purest form - where all your evidence, frames, and strategic positioning culminate in a final appeal that moves people to action.

## UNDERSTANDING WHY CLOSINGS WIN DEBATES

### The Psychology of Endings

**RECENCY EFFECT**: People remember best what they heard last. Your closing statement will echo in the audience's mind long after the debate ends. This isn't just about being memorable - it's about being the final frame through which they interpret everything that came before.

**EMOTIONAL CLIMAX**: Throughout the debate, you've built logical arguments supported by emotion. The closing is where emotion takes center stage, with logic as the foundation. It's the moment when the audience stops analyzing and starts feeling.

**DECISION CRYSTALLIZATION**: Most audience members haven't fully decided during the debate - they're processing, weighing, considering. The closing is often where that internal deliberation resolves into a clear position.

**NARRATIVE COMPLETION**: Humans crave story arcs. Your closing completes the narrative journey you began with your opening, giving the audience the satisfaction of a complete story with a clear resolution.

### The Four Psychological Functions

Every effective closing must accomplish these four psychological tasks:

**AUDIENCE ALIGNMENT**: Make the audience feel favorable toward you and your position while creating distance from your opponent. This isn't about attacking - it's about making your side feel like the natural, obvious choice.

**STAKES AMPLIFICATION**: Show what's truly at risk and what's genuinely possible. The audience must feel that something important hangs in the balance - that their decision matters beyond this room.

**EMOTIONAL ACTIVATION**: Place the audience "under the influence of passion" - make them feel something visceral about your position. Logic convinces the mind, but emotion moves people to act.

**MEMORY CRYSTALLIZATION**: Distill your entire argument into its most essential, memorable form. Give them something they can carry with them and repeat to others.

## THE THREE CLOSING ARCHETYPES

### TYPE 1: THE AUTHORITY CLOSING (Quote)
**Psychological Function**: Introduces a "second voice" that validates your position
**Emotional Impact**: Gives audience permission to agree with you
**When This Works**: When you need to overcome audience hesitation or add gravitas

**The Architecture**:
- **Setup**: Brief context that connects the quote to your argument
- **Quote**: Powerful words from a respected source that crystallize your position  
- **Application**: Why these words matter for this decision, in this moment

**Quote Selection Criteria**:
- **Relevance**: Must directly support your core argument, not just sound impressive
- **Authority**: Source must be respected by THIS audience (not just generally famous)
- **Memorability**: Should be quotable on its own - something people will remember and repeat
- **Emotional Resonance**: Must connect to feelings, not just logic

**Example Framework**:
"[Brief setup that connects to your argument]. As [respected figure] once said, '[powerful quote].' That's exactly what we face today - [application to current situation]."

**Delivery Strategy**:
- Pause before the quote to build anticipation
- Deliver the quote with conviction, as if you believe every word
- Pause after to let it sink in
- Connect it directly to the audience's decision

### TYPE 2: THE HUMAN CLOSING (Anecdote)
**Psychological Function**: Makes abstract arguments concrete through human experience
**Emotional Impact**: Creates empathy and personal connection
**When This Works**: When you need to make the issue feel real and immediate

**The Architecture**:
- **Character**: A person the audience can relate to or care about
- **Situation**: A moment that embodies your argument's core truth
- **Resolution**: How this story illuminates what's at stake in the debate

**Story Selection Criteria**:
- **Representativeness**: Must genuinely represent your argument, not be an outlier
- **Emotional Accessibility**: Audience must be able to imagine themselves in this situation
- **Concrete Stakes**: Must show real consequences, not abstract principles
- **Universal Resonance**: Should tap into experiences or fears most people share

**Example Framework**:
"Let me tell you about [relatable person]. [Brief story that embodies your argument]. That's what this debate is really about - [connection to broader principle]."

**Delivery Strategy**:
- Tell it like you're sharing something personal, not performing
- Use present tense to make it immediate ("She walks into the office...")
- Pause at the emotional climax to let the audience feel it
- Connect the story's meaning to their decision clearly

### TYPE 3: THE MOBILIZATION CLOSING (Call to Action)
**Psychological Function**: Channels emotion into specific action
**Emotional Impact**: Transforms feeling into empowerment
**When This Works**: When the audience is convinced but needs direction

**The Architecture**:
- **Urgency**: Why action is needed now, not later
- **Clarity**: Exactly what you want them to think, feel, or do
- **Empowerment**: How their action makes a meaningful difference

**Action Selection Criteria**:
- **Specificity**: Must be concrete enough to act on immediately
- **Feasibility**: Must be something this audience can actually do
- **Impact**: Must feel meaningful, not token or symbolic
- **Connection**: Must flow naturally from your argument

**Example Framework**:
"The choice is clear. The time is now. [Specific action you want]. Because [why their action matters]."

**Delivery Strategy**:
- Build energy throughout - this should feel like a crescendo
- Use direct address ("You have the power to...")
- Make eye contact across the entire audience
- End with absolute conviction and certainty

## STRATEGIC BRIEF INTEGRATION

### Mining Your Strategic Foundation

**IF Strategic Brief identifies audience values**:

**IF Strategic Brief outlines key takeaway**:
- Your closing should crystallize that takeaway into its most memorable form
- Don't just repeat it - make the audience FEEL why it matters

- Anecdote: Stories that find common ground, shared humanity
- Action: Small steps they can take without abandoning their core beliefs

## SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS

### Connecting to Your Opening

Your closing should create a narrative arc with your opening:

**Echo Structure**: If you opened with a question, close with the answer. If you opened with a story, close with its resolution. If you opened with a challenge, close with the solution.

**Emotional Journey**: Show how the audience has traveled from the opening moment to this conclusion. What have they learned? How have they grown?

**Circular Completion**: Reference your opening hook in a way that shows how the entire debate has led to this moment of clarity.

### Integrating Your Strongest Elements

**Reference Your Best Frame**: Don't re-argue it, but echo the emotional core of your most powerful argument frame. Let the audience remember why it resonated.

**Echo Your Best Evidence**: If you had a particularly powerful piece of evidence, you can reference it briefly - but don't introduce new receipts.

**Acknowledge the Journey**: Show that you've heard the debate, considered the opposition, and arrived at this conclusion thoughtfully.

## GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Elements
- Each closing must synthesize your opening, strongest frame, and audience values
- Stakes must be clear and compelling (what's at risk, what's possible, why now)
- Emotional journey must be specific and intentional
- Delivery strategy must be detailed enough to execute
- Deployment context must help choose the right closing for the moment

### Quality Criteria

**SYNTHESIS TEST**:
- Does this feel like the natural culmination of your entire argument?
- Can you trace a clear line from opening hook to this closing?
- Does it reinforce your strongest frame without re-arguing it?

**EMOTIONAL IMPACT TEST**:
- Will the audience feel something specific when this ends?
- Is the emotional journey clear and intentional?
- Does it move beyond "informed" to "moved"?

**MEMORABILITY TEST**:
- Could someone quote the final sentence tomorrow?
- Does it have rhythm, imagery, or parallel structure?
- Would this end up in a "great debate moments" compilation?

**ACTION ORIENTATION TEST**:
- Is it clear what the audience should think/feel/do after this?
- Does it channel emotion into specific direction?
- Will they leave knowing how to act on what they've heard?

**AUDIENCE RESONANCE TEST**:
- Does this speak to THIS audience's specific values and concerns?
- Would this land differently with a different audience?
- Does it use language and references they'll connect with?

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The New Argument Problem**: Introducing fresh evidence or logic in the closing
- Closing is for synthesis and emotion, not new information

**The Weak Ending Problem**: Trailing off or ending uncertainly
- Must end with conviction and clarity - audience needs to know it's over

**The Generic Inspiration Problem**: Motivational speaking that could apply to any topic
- Must be specifically connected to your argument and this debate

**The Overexplained Connection Problem**: Spelling out every connection to earlier material
- Synthesis should feel natural, not mechanical

**The Mismatched Emotion Problem**: Ending on an emotion that doesn't fit your argument
- Emotional arc must align with your position and desired action

## DEPLOYMENT WISDOM

### Reading the Room

**Audience Energy Level**:
- High energy: Call to Action closing to channel momentum
- Low energy: Anecdote closing to re-engage emotionally  
- Mixed energy: Quote closing to provide authoritative clarity

**Debate Momentum**:
- You're ahead: Reinforce with Quote or Action closing
- You're behind: Reframe with Anecdote closing
- It's even: Go with your strongest emotional appeal

**Time Remaining**:
- Plenty of time: Anecdote closing with full story development
- Limited time: Quote closing for maximum impact per word
- Very limited: Action closing for clear, direct appeal

### The Final Moment

**Physical Presence**: Stand tall, make eye contact across the room, project confidence
**Vocal Delivery**: Clear, strong voice that carries conviction
**Timing**: Pause before the final sentence, deliver it with certainty, pause after
**Exit Strategy**: Don't rush away - let the moment hang, then step back with dignity

### Recovery Protocols

**If Closing Falls Flat**:
- Don't acknowledge it failed
- Don't try to add more - the moment has passed
- Exit with dignity and confidence

**If You Lose Your Place**:
- Pause, breathe, find your core message
- Deliver the essence even if not the exact words
- End with conviction regardless

### The Aristotelian Foundation

Your closing accomplishes four ancient rhetorical functions in modern form:

1. **Audience Alignment**: Make them favorable to you, skeptical of opponent
2. **Stakes Amplification**: Show what matters, why it matters, why now matters  
3. **Emotional Activation**: Move them to feel something powerful about your position
4. **Memory Crystallization**: Give them something to remember and repeat

This isn't just technique - it's the culmination of everything you've built throughout the debate, crystallized into its most powerful, emotionally resonant form.
