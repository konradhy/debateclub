## About the Product: DebateClub (OratorPrep)

**Product Name:** DebateClub (also known as OratorPrep)

**What It Does:**
DebateClub is an AI-powered debate practice platform that helps users master persuasion and argumentation skills through simulated conversations with an AI opponent. Based on Mehdi Hasan's book "Win Every Argument," the platform trains users on 12 core debate techniques through live practice and personalized feedback.

**Target Audiences:**
- Startup founders (investor pitches, fundraising)
- Job seekers (interviews, salary negotiation)
- Sales professionals (objection handling, closing)
- Attorneys and legal professionals (courtroom, depositions)
- Politicians and activists (town halls, media appearances)
- Healthcare professionals (patient conversations, family meetings)
- Academics and researchers (thesis defense, conference Q&A)
- Parents and educators (difficult conversations with kids/students)
- Presenters (Q&A sessions, handling interruptions)
- Anyone facing difficult conversations or high-stakes communication

**Core Value Proposition:**
Most people lose arguments not because they're wrong, but because they can't articulate their position under pressure. DebateClub provides a safe environment to practice handling tough questions, detecting fallacies, and delivering crisp answers before the stakes are real.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Based on proven framework (Mehdi Hasan's book)
- AI opponent deliberately uses fallacies and weak arguments to train detection
- Post-debate analysis with technique scoring (1-5 on 12 techniques)
- Scenario-based practice (customize for your specific use case)
- Evergreen content strategy (blog posts are timeless technique guides)

## Your Task

Create a complete social media marketing plan for ONE piece of content (blog post or use case page). The plan must:

1. **Score 4.5+ on the provided rubric** (5-point scale across 5 categories)
2. **Follow the template structure exactly** (all sections completed)
3. **Match or exceed the reference example quality** (see example-plan-pitching-fundraising.md)
4. **Be immediately executable** (ready-to-post content, not vague suggestions)
5. **Optimize for 2025 best practices** (platform algorithms, user behavior, content formats)

---

## Required Reference Files

You MUST review these three files before creating your plan:

### 1. Template Structure
**File:** `social-media-plan-template.md`

This provides the exact structure your output must follow, including:
- Core insight definition
- Reddit strategy (subreddits, titles, post examples)
- Twitter/X strategy (threads, standalone tweets)
- LinkedIn strategy (posts, carousels, visual assets)
- Short-form video strategy (TikTok/Reels/Shorts scripts)
- Image/visual asset specifications
- Content calendar
- Success metrics
- Repurposing plan
- Notes & learnings section

**Do not skip any sections.** Fill out every part of the template with specific, actionable content.

---

### 2. Quality Rubric
**File:** `social-media-plan-template.md` (Rubric section)

Your plan will be evaluated on these 5 categories (weighted):

1. **Strategic Alignment (25%)** - Is the core insight clear, specific, and valuable?
2. **Platform Adaptation (30%)** - Is content customized for each platform's culture?
3. **Content Quality (20%)** - Is it actionable, specific, and engaging?
4. **Execution Readiness (15%)** - Can someone execute this immediately?
5. **80/20 Efficiency (10%)** - Does it focus on high-ROI activities?

**Target Score: 4.5-5.0** ("Excellent" - Ready to execute, high confidence)

**Minimum Acceptable Score: 4.0** ("Good" - Minor tweaks needed)

**Below 4.0 = Needs rework**

---

### 3. Reference Example (Gold Standard)
**File:** `example-plan-pitching-fundraising.md`

This is a complete, 5.0-scored marketing plan for the Pitching/Fundraising use case. It demonstrates:

- **Core insight quality:** "VCs don't reject bad ideas, they reject unprepared founders who can't answer the 6 hard questions"
- **Platform customization:** Same insight, 3 different Reddit titles for 3 different communities
- **Complete content:** Full Reddit posts written out (not summaries), complete tweet threads, full LinkedIn posts
- **Specific examples:** Real scenarios, data points, personal stories
- **Video scripts:** Shot-by-shot breakdowns with timing and text overlays
- **Engagement plans:** Pre-written responses to common questions
- **Metrics:** Specific targets (150+ upvotes, not "good engagement")

**Study this example carefully.** Your output should match this level of detail and specificity.

---

## Input Format

You will receive ONE content piece to create a marketing plan for. It will be provided in this format:

```
CONTENT TYPE: [Blog Post | Use Case Page]
TITLE: [Title of the content]
URL SLUG: [/blog/slug or /use-cases/slug]
PRIMARY AUDIENCE: [Who this content targets]
KEY THEMES: [Main topics/concepts covered]
UNIQUE ANGLE: [What makes this content different/valuable]
```

---

## Output Requirements

### 1. Core Insight (CRITICAL)

Start by identifying the ONE memorable takeaway. This must be:
- **Specific** (not "practice makes perfect," but "most founders fumble 3 of 6 questions VCs always ask")
- **Reframing** (changes how audience thinks about the problem)
- **Actionable** (implies a clear solution)
- **Memorable** (can be stated in 1-2 sentences)
- **Differentiated** (not generic advice everyone gives)

**Test:** Can someone repeat this insight to a colleague 3 days later from memory?

---

### 2. Reddit Strategy (HIGH PRIORITY - 40% of effort)

Reddit is your highest-ROI platform. For EACH content piece, you must:

**A. Identify 3-5 Target Subreddits**
- Include member count
- Assess cultural fit (Low/Medium/High promotional risk)
- Explain WHY this subreddit cares about this topic

**B. Create Custom Titles for Each Subreddit**
- Do NOT use the same title across subreddits
- Adapt to community language and values
- Examples:
  - r/startups: "The 6 VC questions founders fumble (and how to nail them)"
  - r/Entrepreneur: "I analyzed 100 failed pitches. 73% failed on the same question."
  - r/venturecapital: "What founders miss when answering 'Why you?' in pitch meetings"

**C. Write 1-2 Complete Reddit Posts**
- Full text, ready to copy/paste
- 300-500 words
- Opening hook (2-3 sentences establishing credibility)
- 3-5 specific, actionable insights
- Examples and scenarios (not generic advice)
- Engagement question at the end
- NO promotional language (mention tool only if asked)
- Show cultural fit for that specific subreddit

**D. Prepare Engagement Responses**
- 2-3 pre-written responses to likely questions
- How to handle "How did you practice this?" (opportunity to mention tool)
- How to handle skepticism
- How to handle requests for more detail

**Reddit Success Criteria:**
- Would a moderator approve this? (not promotional)
- Would the community upvote this? (valuable, not self-serving)
- Does it spark discussion? (open-ended question)
- Is it specific to this subreddit? (not generic cross-post)

---

### 3. Twitter/X Strategy (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 25% of effort)

**A. Create One Complete Thread (5-7 tweets)**
- Hook tweet that stops the scroll (controversial, surprising, or high-value promise)
- Logical flow (each tweet builds on previous)
- Standalone value (each tweet works alone if needed)
- Specific examples (not vague principles)
- Soft CTA at end (link to blog)
- 2-3 hashtags MAX (avoid spam)

**B. Create 3-4 Standalone Tweet Ideas**
- Different angles on same core insight
- Variety: Data point, personal story, controversial take, engagement question
- Each tweet complete and ready to post

**Formatting:**
- Write out the actual tweets
- Mark where line breaks go
- Specify hashtags
- Note any images/visuals needed

**Twitter Success Criteria:**
- Hook is strong enough to stop mid-scroll
- Thread tells a complete story
- Not just repurposed blog content (adapted for Twitter's style)
- Invites engagement (replies, quotes, shares)

---

### 4. LinkedIn Strategy (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 20% of effort)

**A. Write One Complete Long-Form Post**
- Personal story hook (first 1-2 sentences)
- Professional angle (relevant to career/business)
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Line breaks for readability
- 300-500 words total
- Actionable framework or insights
- Engagement question at end
- Link to blog in first comment (not in post)

**B. Design a Carousel Concept (6-10 slides)**
- Specify content for each slide
- Title slide + 4-8 content slides + CTA slide
- Slide format: Headline + 2-3 bullets or key point
- Design style notes (minimalist, brand colors, etc.)

**LinkedIn Success Criteria:**
- Professional but personal (not corporate speak)
- Shows vulnerability or learning (not just expertise)
- Formatted for mobile reading (short paragraphs, line breaks)
- Provides framework others can use

---

### 5. Short-Form Video Strategy (GROWING PRIORITY - 15% of effort)

**A. Create 2 Video Concepts**

For EACH video, provide:

**Script with Timing:**
- 0-3 sec: Hook (what stops the scroll)
- 3-15 sec: Setup (establish scenario/problem)
- 15-45 sec: Payoff (deliver the insight/solution)
- 45-60 sec: CTA (soft call-to-action)

**Visual Direction:**
- Shot type (talking head, screen recording, role-play, etc.)
- On-screen text overlays (list specific text)
- B-roll or visual elements needed
- Captions requirements (must work without sound)

**Platform Specs:**
- Format: Vertical (9:16) or square (1:1)
- Length: 30-60 seconds (shorter = better completion rate)
- Captions: Required for TikTok/Reels
- Hashtags: 5-8 for discovery

**Video Success Criteria:**
- Hook works without sound (text overlay + visual)
- Can be filmed in 1-2 hours
- Doesn't require expensive production
- Demonstrates the concept visually (not just talking about it)

## Strategic Principles

### 80/20 Focus

**High ROI Activities (Prioritize):**
1. Reddit posts in highly-targeted communities
2. LinkedIn thought leadership with personal stories
3. Short-form video (highest organic reach in 2025)
4. Twitter threads (shareable, high engagement potential)

**Lower ROI Activities (Deprioritize):**
- Instagram feed posts (unless you have visual assets)
- Facebook (unless targeting 40+ demographic)
- Threads (still finding product-market fit)
- Multiple platforms poorly > few platforms well

---

### Content Repurposing

Every piece of content should have:
- **Week 1:** Initial launch across 3-4 platforms
- **Week 2-4:** Quote cards, video clips, carousel posts
- **Month 2:** Re-share in different communities
- **Month 3+:** Update with new data/examples, re-launch

**Maximize value from each piece:**
- 1 blog post → 3 Reddit posts → 1 Twitter thread + 4 tweets → 1 LinkedIn post → 2 videos → 5 quote cards
- Total: 15+ social assets from 1 blog post

---

### Engagement Strategy

**First 2 Hours Are Critical:**
- Set reminder to monitor posts
- Reply to every comment quickly
- Upvote/like thoughtful responses
- Ask follow-up questions to drive discussion

**Prepared Responses:**
- "How did you practice this?" → Opportunity to mention tool
- Skepticism → "You're right it's simple, but simple ≠ easy. Practice is the hard part."
- Request for more detail → Link to blog post naturally
