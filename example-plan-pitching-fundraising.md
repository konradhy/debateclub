## Core Insight

**The ONE thing people should remember:**

"VCs don't reject pitches because the idea is bad—they reject them because founders can't handle the 6 hard questions that come up in every investor meeting. The difference between funded and unfunded founders is practice under pressure."

**Why this works:**
- Reframes failure (not your idea, it's your preparation)
- Specific (6 questions, not vague "be better")
- Implies solution (practice)
- Addresses real pain (most founders don't practice enough)

### Example Title Variations:

#### 1. r/startups: "The 6 VC questions that kill pitches (and how to answer them confidently)"

**Why this works:**
- Numbers grab attention (6 specific questions)
- Addresses pain point directly (questions that "kill" pitches)
- Promises solution (how to answer)
- Not clickbait—delivers on promise

**Sample Post:**
```
The 6 VC questions that kill pitches (and how to answer them confidently)

I've watched 100+ pitch meetings over the past 2 years (as a founder and
observer). The pitches that get funded aren't necessarily the best ideas—
they're the ones where founders can handle these 6 questions without fumbling:

1. "Why you?"
   - Bad answer: Lists your resume
   - Good answer: Shows your unique insight into the problem that competitors miss

2. "What if [BigCo] builds this?"
   - Bad answer: "They won't" or "We'll be acquired"
   - Good answer: Explains why your specific advantage (speed, focus, insight)
     means you'll still win

3. "Your numbers seem aggressive"
   - Bad answer: Gets defensive or backs down completely
   - Good answer: Walks through assumptions, shows the math, stays confident

4. "Why now?"
   - Bad answer: Generic market trends
   - Good answer: Specific catalyst that makes this the moment (regulatory
     change, tech breakthrough, behavior shift)

5. "What keeps you up at night?"
   - Bad answer: "Nothing" or lists 10 things
   - Good answer: Names 1-2 real risks, then explains mitigation plan

6. "Why this valuation?"
   - Bad answer: "That's what we need" or "Comparables"
   - Good answer: Ties to milestones you'll hit with this capital

The pattern I see: Funded founders have crisp, practiced answers. Unfunded
founders ramble or get defensive.

Here's what I did before my last fundraise:
- Wrote out all 6 answers
- Practiced them out loud (felt dumb, but worked)
- Did 5 "practice pitches" with founders who'd raised before
- By the real meetings, I could handle interruptions and pivots smoothly

The pitch that got us to term sheet wasn't because our deck was prettier.
It's because I didn't fumble when the GP asked "What if Stripe builds this?"

What questions trip you up most? I'm curious if others see the same patterns.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Starts with credibility (100+ pitches observed)
- ✅ Reframes the problem (not idea quality, answer quality)
- ✅ Gives specific, actionable framework (bad vs good answers)
- ✅ Personal story shows vulnerability (felt dumb practicing)
- ✅ Proof point (got to term sheet)
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
- ✅ Zero promotional language
- ✅ If someone asks "how did you practice?" → can mention tool naturally

---

#### 2. r/Entrepreneur: "I analyzed 100 failed investor pitches. 73% failed on the same question."

**Why this works:**
- Data hook (100 pitches, 73%)
- Mystery element (which question?)
- Relevant to broader entrepreneur audience (not just VC-backed)

**Sample Post:**
```
I analyzed 100 failed investor pitches. 73% failed on the same question.

The question: "What if [BigCo] builds this?"

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Stripe—whatever the big player in your space is,
VCs will ask about them. And most founders have terrible answers.

Common bad answers I heard:
- "They won't because [hand-waving]" (Yes, they might)
- "We'll be acquired by them!" (Not a plan)
- "We'll pivot if they do" (Shows no conviction)
- "Our tech is better" (They have 1000x your resources)

The founders who got funded said things like:

"Stripe could build payment infrastructure for [our market]. But they won't
because it's a $200M market, not a $20B market. We can focus 100% here while
they focus on enterprises. By the time it's big enough for them to care, we'll
have the relationships locked in."

Or:

"Google tried this in 2019 and shut it down. Not because it didn't work—
because it required hands-on customer service they don't do. We built our
entire company around that service layer."

The pattern: Acknowledge the threat, explain your specific advantage, show
why that advantage is sustainable.

I used to think this question was a trap. Now I realize it's a gift—it lets
you show you've thought critically about competition and have a real answer.

Before my last fundraise, I literally wrote out the answer for every potential
competitor (took 2 hours). In the actual meetings, when this came up, I was
ready. No fumbling, no panic.

The pitch that got us to term sheet included this exact question. I gave a
30-second answer that showed I'd thought it through. Partner nodded and moved on.

That 2 hours of prep probably saved the round.

How do you handle this question? I'm curious what answers work for different industries.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Data-driven hook
- ✅ Addresses universal founder fear (big tech competition)
- ✅ Contrasts bad vs good answers clearly
- ✅ Shows ROI of prep (2 hours saved the round)
- ✅ Asks for community input
- ✅ Builds credibility without being promotional

---

#### 3. r/venturecapital: "What founders miss when answering 'Why you?' in pitch meetings"

**Why this works:**
- Inside baseball (VC perspective)
- Addresses common mistake
- Shows understanding of what VCs actually want

**Sample Post:**
```
What founders miss when answering "Why you?" in pitch meetings

I've been on both sides of this question (as founder and advisor sitting in
on partner meetings). Here's what I see founders get wrong:

Most founders answer "Why you?" by listing their resume:
- "I worked at Google for 5 years"
- "I have a PhD in Computer Science"
- "I started 2 companies before"

That's not what VCs are asking.

What they're actually asking is: "What unique insight do you have that means
you'll win when others won't?"

The best answer I've heard:

"I spent 3 years as a nurse in ICU. I watched doctors make the same medication
errors over and over—not because they were bad doctors, but because the
software they use is designed for billing, not safety. Every competitor in
this space is building tools for hospital administrators. We're the only team
building for the people actually entering the orders. That's why our retention
is 95% and theirs is 60%."

That answer works because:
1. Shows insider knowledge (ICU nurse perspective)
2. Explains why competitors miss it (they build for wrong user)
3. Ties to traction (95% vs 60% retention)
4. Makes clear why this team specifically will win

Compare that to: "I have 10 years in healthcare IT and worked at Epic."

The latter is credentials. The former is insight.

Before my last raise, I rewrote my "Why you?" answer 6 times. The first
version was my resume. The final version was the specific thing I learned
that everyone else in the market is getting wrong.

When I gave that answer in the pitch, the partner literally said "That's the
insight." We got the term sheet 3 days later.

What's your "Why you?" answer? I'm curious how others approach this.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Teaches from experience (both sides of table)
- ✅ Specific example (ICU nurse → software)
- ✅ Framework (credentials vs insight)
- ✅ Shows iteration process (rewrote 6 times)
- ✅ Proof point (got term sheet)
- ✅ Asks for community examples

### Engagement Plan

**First 2 Hours After Posting:**
- Set phone reminder to check every 30 minutes
- Upvote thoughtful comments
- Reply to every question with detailed answer
- Don't link to product unless specifically asked "how did you practice?"

**Prepared Responses:**

If someone asks: "How did you practice these answers?"
```
"I did a few things:
1. Wrote them all out (sounds basic, but most people skip this)
2. Recorded myself on Zoom saying them out loud (cringy but helpful)
3. Did practice pitches with founders who'd raised before
4. Used an AI tool that simulates VC questions (DM me if you want the link,
   don't want to be promotional in comments)

The biggest unlock was actually saying the answers out loud under pressure.
Writing them isn't enough."
```

If someone asks: "What if I don't have a good answer to one of these?"
```
"That's actually valuable information. If you can't answer 'Why now?' or
'Why you?' convincingly, that might be a sign to strengthen your positioning
before fundraising. I delayed my raise by 2 months to build more traction
specifically so I could answer 'What keeps you up at night?' with confidence.

Better to pause and get the answer right than to raise on weak positioning."
```

If someone is skeptical: "This seems too simple"
```
"You're right that it's simple. But simple ≠ easy. The hard part isn't knowing
what questions VCs ask (everyone knows that). The hard part is being able to
answer them clearly under pressure, when you're nervous, when they interrupt
you mid-pitch.

Reading about it takes 5 minutes. Getting good at it takes hours of practice.
Most founders skip the practice part."
```

## Twitter/X Strategy

### Thread Structure (7 tweets)

**Hook Tweet:**
"VCs ask the same 6 questions in every pitch meeting. Most founders fumble at least 3 of them. Here's how to answer each one so you actually get the term sheet:"

**Full Thread:**

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
VCs ask the same 6 questions in every pitch meeting.

Most founders fumble at least 3 of them.

Here's how to answer each one so you actually get the term sheet:
```

**Tweet 2 (Setup):**
```
I watched 100+ pitches over 2 years. The pattern is clear:

Funded founders have crisp, practiced answers.
Unfunded founders ramble or get defensive.

It's not about having the best idea. It's about handling pressure.

The 6 questions:
```

**Tweet 3 ("Why you?"):**
```
1. "Why you?"

❌ Bad: Lists your resume
✅ Good: "I'm the only one who knows [specific insight competitors miss]"

Example: "I was an ICU nurse. Every competitor builds for admins. We build for nurses. That's why our retention is 95% vs their 60%."

Credentials < Insight
```

**Tweet 4 ("What if BigCo builds this?"):**
```
2. "What if [Amazon/Google/Stripe] builds this?"

❌ Bad: "They won't" or "We'll be acquired"
✅ Good: Acknowledge threat, explain your sustainable advantage

"Stripe tried this in 2019. It needs hands-on service they don't do. We built our company around that."
```

**Tweet 5 (Numbers + Risks):**
```
3. "Your numbers seem aggressive"

❌ Bad: Gets defensive
✅ Good: Walk through assumptions, show the math

4. "What keeps you up at night?"

❌ Bad: "Nothing" or lists 10 things
✅ Good: Name 1-2 real risks + mitigation plan

Show you've thought it through
```

**Tweet 6 (Why now + Valuation):**
```
5. "Why now?"

❌ Bad: Generic trends
✅ Good: Specific catalyst (regulatory change, tech breakthrough, behavior shift)

6. "Why this valuation?"

❌ Bad: "That's what we need"
✅ Good: Tie to milestones you'll hit with this capital

Be specific. Always.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
```
The pitch that got us to term sheet wasn't because our deck was prettier.

It's because I didn't fumble when the partner asked "What if Stripe builds this?"

I practiced these answers out loud 50+ times before the meetings.

Simple? Yes.
Easy? No.

Practice wins.

### Standalone Tweet Ideas

**Tweet 1 (Controversial):**
```
Most founders spend 40 hours on their pitch deck and 0 hours practicing
what they'll say when interrupted.

Then wonder why they didn't get the term sheet.

Your deck doesn't close rounds. Your answers do.
```

**Tweet 2 (Data point):**
```
I analyzed 100 failed investor pitches.

73% failed on the same question: "What if [BigCo] builds this?"

Not because they had bad answers.
Because they had no answer.

VCs can smell unprepared from a mile away.
```

**Tweet 3 (Personal story):**
```
The moment I knew we'd get the term sheet:

VC: "What if Stripe builds this?"
Me: [30-second answer I'd practiced 50 times]
VC: *nods* "Okay, next question"

That 30 seconds was the result of 10 hours of practice.

Worth it.
```

**Tweet 4 (Engagement driver):**
```
Founders: What's the VC question that trips you up most?

- "Why you?"
- "What if BigCo builds this?"
- "Why now?"
- "What keeps you up at night?"

Reply with the one you struggle with. I'll share how I prep for each.
```

## LinkedIn Strategy

### Post Angle
**Hook Type:** Personal Story with Data

**Opening Line:**
"I watched my co-founder fumble a $2M round because he couldn't answer one question."

---

### Full Post

```
I watched my co-founder fumble a $2M round because he couldn't answer one question.

The question: "What if Stripe builds this?"

He froze. Rambled for 90 seconds. Said "well, they probably won't..."

The VC nodded. Moved on. We didn't get the term sheet.

---

Three months later, I ran the same pitch to a different VC.

Same question came up.

This time I said:

"Stripe tried this in 2019 and shut it down after 8 months. Not because it didn't work—because it required hands-on customer service for every implementation. They're not set up for that. We are. That service layer is our entire business model."

The partner literally said: "That's the answer I needed."

We had a term sheet in 5 days.

---

The difference wasn't our idea. Our idea was the same.

The difference was 10 hours of practice.

Here's what I did between those two pitches:

→ Wrote out answers to the 6 questions VCs always ask
→ Practiced them out loud (felt ridiculous, but worked)
→ Did mock pitches with 5 founders who'd raised before
→ Got interrupted, pushed back on, challenged
→ Refined answers until they were crisp

By the time I walked into the real meeting, I'd answered "What if BigCo builds this?" 50 times.

So when it came up, I didn't freeze. I didn't ramble. I gave a 30-second answer and moved on.

---

Most founders spend 40 hours on their deck and 0 hours on their delivery.

Then they wonder why they didn't get funded.

Your slides don't close rounds. Your answers do.

---

The 6 questions you WILL get asked:

1. "Why you?" (not your resume—your unique insight)
2. "What if [BigCo] builds this?" (acknowledge + sustainable advantage)
3. "Your numbers seem aggressive" (walk through assumptions)
4. "Why now?" (specific catalyst, not generic trends)
5. "What keeps you up at night?" (1-2 risks + mitigation)
6. "Why this valuation?" (tie to milestones)

Write your answers. Practice them out loud. Do it before you book meetings.

The difference between funded and unfunded isn't always the better idea.

Sometimes it's just better preparation.
