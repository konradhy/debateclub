## EXAMPLE: COMPLETED PLAN SNIPPET

Here's what a high-scoring plan section looks like:

### Reddit Strategy - "Spot the Weakness" Blog Post

#### Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Members | Title Variation | Approach | Risk Level |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| r/debate | 50k | "The 5 logical fallacies you'll encounter most (and how to call them out)" | Value-first | Low |
| r/sales | 300k | "When prospects use bad logic to dodge objections - and how to handle it professionally" | Story | Medium |
| r/careerguidance | 500k | "How to spot when someone is arguing in bad faith (job interviews, negotiations, difficult conversations)" | Value-first | Low |

**Post Format for r/sales:**

**Title:** "When prospects use bad logic to dodge objections - and how to handle it professionally"

**Opening:**
```
I've been in sales for 8 years and I finally figured out why some objections
feel impossible to overcome.

It's not that the prospect has a legitimate concern. It's that they're using
logically flawed arguments - and most salespeople don't know how to call it
out without sounding condescending.

Here are the 3 I see most often:
```

**Body:** [3-5 specific examples with how to respond]

**Closing:**
```
The key is to call out the flaw in the logic without making them feel stupid.
Name the pattern, explain why it doesn't hold up, then redirect to the real
conversation.

Anyone else notice these patterns? What objections trip you up most?
```

**Why this scores high:**
- ✅ Title is customized for r/sales (not generic "fallacy detection")
- ✅ Opening establishes credibility (8 years in sales)
- ✅ Solves a specific pain point (objections that feel impossible)
- ✅ Provides actionable framework (name, explain, redirect)
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
- ✅ No promotional language (tool not mentioned)
